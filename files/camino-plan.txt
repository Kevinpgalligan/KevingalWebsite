- If you can, walk to Cape Finisterre to see the sunset (sounds cool)
- Main route, and busiest route, is Camino Francés.
- Camino del Norte: reputed to be less forgiving in terms of accommodation, routes, etc., but it's not actually so bad. One person reported getting lost a couple of times, but it was fine.
- Basic survival: don't walk during hottest part of day, have water at all times.
- PACK LIGHT. One person reported having 2 sets of clothes, they changed clothes after showering.
- "There are lots of rest stops along the path each day and if you ever need assistance, there is always someone there to help, including getting a ride. Some days are harder than others (day 3 was a rough one for me) but it will not take long for you to get your trail legs and find your perfect pace."
- Pack good blister bandage (Compeed is the best)
- "There are many cafes along the way.", sounds like you can stop in to eat somewhere every day.

- Packing advice: "You are sensible to want to reduce the weight of your backpack, and this is easier than you think. Leave all your electronic devices at home, with the exception of your mobile telephone and its charging device. (Personally I wouldn't take that either, but I know that I'm showing my age when I say so.) For clothing, bring two T-shirts, two pairs of short pants, two sets of underwear, two pairs of socks, one lightweight rain poncho that can go over your backpack and, if it's hot, nothing else. (If the forecast includes some cold weather, add a light woollen sweater.) Wear the first set of clothes when you walk. When you reach the albergue each day, change into the second set, which you can also use for sleeping, and wash the first set. Do the same thing every night until you reach SdC. Other than whatever toiletries you use, and a water bottle, there's nothing else that you actually need. Everything else that you may bring with you is a luxury."
- "Protecting your head from the sun is important. A wide-brimmed but lightweight straw hat works best."
- More packing advice: "2 pair of walking shorts/pants, 2 pairs of shirts, 2 pairs of good socks (merino wool if possible, socks are important cause you'll have blisters with not good quality socks), clothes for sleeping, 2 pairs of underwears. When you arrive at the albergue change into the other clothes and wash the ones you were wearing."
  "Phone and charger, suncream, toiletries, microfiber towel and a 1L bottle of water, some personal bandages, paracetamol. Maybe a light coat too cause it's now cold in the evening and early morning"
  "some people put a dab of vaseline between the toes."

On whether to get rid of a fleece: https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/comments/15dp3ul/climate_as_the_camino_frances_continues_west/
- "I’d keep them. I did the Frances in April/May and it was cold at first then hot through the Messetta but then got cold again in the evening after that. But that was earlier in the season obviously. But having a fleece def came in clutch well after I was certain I wouldn’t need it anymore."
- "I’d keep them, the nights/mornings can get chilly. Also, I just came out of the meseta and first day coming into Galicia through the mountains it was 10 degrees out and raining. Sometimes albergues can be super cold as well so it’s nice to be able to layer clothes."

On expectations: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/gygm6n/is_el_camino_de_santiago_everything_and_more/
- Question about going in October: "One day out of 8 was cloudy, rainy, and cold. Every other day sunny and warm. It was still crowded, but never had a problem finding a room or a bed."

Someone's packing list: https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/comments/15ck6fv/packing_list_for_portuguese_coastal_camino_in/ 
- Sunglasses.
- Ooh, nice idea: all valuables in a dry bag that you can take to shower, dinner, whatever.

- On whether you should book ahead: "Taking it day by day is fine after the first couple of days if you start early and don't do super long days"
- Seems like many albergues closed due to COVID.

- "Landscape-wise, to me, nothing can beat the Camino del Norte. So many breathtaking views and more beaches than you could wish for. But it is physically more challenging, especially until Bilbao"
- On staying at towns to explore: "There are many beautiful towns and often your feet will tell you when you need a break. Personally I never stayed 2 days at a place, but when there was an interesting town coming up, I planned on arriving there early, with only a short walk that day. This way I'd have enough time to explore and also enough "foot-power"to do so :D"
- "Definitely would recommend the Frances! I would also recommend great socks (REI has great hiking ones) and sticking to 22 km or less per day. Take it slow and enjoy the camino."
- "As for finding a place to sleep, Frances is known for its albergue races, but as long as you arrive around 14:00 you should be fine. If you want much longer days, then either call ahead private albergues and reserve a spot or consider more secluded trail instead."
- Hmmm, makes me think I should consider the mainstream Frances trail: "Essentially on Norte you're walking along the northern coast of Spain with lots of sea views, and most of the time you walk up 200m and down 200m, which piles up often to 1000-1500m elevation changes a day. Then around Oviedo/Gijon/Aviles you can turn inland from Norte to Primitivo and exchange seaside for hills and low mountains."
- "You can always start in Pamplona if you want to skip the really hard part. The Northern route is beautiful with the ocean on your right side most of the time. The route from Le Puy to St. Jean (Via Podienses) in my opinion has great hostels (gite) amazing views (Aubrac plateau) stunning towns (Conques) and all the French food. It is more expensive then Spain, reservations recommended especially in August and September and the terrain is a bit more challenging. In 2011 I started in Le Puy and walked to Santiago and both routes are different and special in their own way I liked the Camino in France better."

Keep in mind infrastructure is not like on Frances or Portugues (part form Porto) where you have albergues and bars every 5km. It's more 20-30km."
- "real Spaniards and better restaurants do not open until after most pilgrims are already in bed."
- "I've never really planned ahead and while it might seem stressful at first, I ended up really liking the flexibility. Planning out the first night or two is really helpful, though - it's nice to not have to hunt down an albergue the night you arrive in your starting point!"
- "You can do whatever you want - it is just in some of the free/municipal/church alberque you can only stay one night. I believe in the more commercial alberque you stay as long as you want, of course in the hotels too.

You can find very inexpensive rooms for rent like for 20 euros a night in wonderful places like the Basque country. I am so in love with that place. It is like Narnia and Fairy tales and such."
- "I took a few days in Logrono staying in a pansion or something like that in a private room, and also in a monastery called Samos - they had monastery administered rooms for $20 a night with perfect amenities. It was so quiet and blissful and spent my time doing nothing for days, just sat around and ate fruit and tomatoes and cheese and drank beer."

Notes for self:
- Should I buy decent earphones so I have something to listen to?
- Should I bring swimming shorts?
- Bring ukulele? Mixed opinions: https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/comments/15bd8gx/should_i_bring_a_ukulele/

- On being asked about the accommodation situation for camino del norte: "Hello! Well, I haven't really had a problem, but some people have told me that the number of sites has been reduced compared to a few years ago. Many public hostels have closed after COVID.

Euskadi (Basque Country) is considerably more expensive than the rest and there are some places like Zarautz or Donosti (San Sebastian) where it is more difficult to find a public hostel or something for a reasonable price. What I did was to extend some stages and, instead of staying in the typical place, I stayed in another area before or after. For example, instead of staying in Donosti, I stayed a little earlier in the mountains in "Las doce tribus" (it later turned out to be a place run by a "religious community" with some ideas that I don't agree with, but it was certainly an experience and the treatment was friendly, the bread was tasty and the surroundings very cool); instead of Zarautz, I stayed in Guetaria, instead of Guernika I went on to Pozueta and stayed in a very cool Caserío with a very tasty dinner. I also added a few km to the Portugalete stage and instead of staying there I went to Pobeña (I thought it was a much nicer environment and the person who was there that day was very nice, plus it coincided with the day of Santiago Apostle and they invited us to dinner and Txacoli and it was very cool).

I think it depends on how flexible you are, what I usually do the day before is to look at the next day or the next two days and go and see, although some people already have everything ready to go. On some places you can book before!

To check the acommodstion i use this: https://www.gronze.com/camino-norte altough It may not have all of the places but it's pretty updated!

I highly recommend to stay at La cabaña del abuelo Peuto in Güemes, such a lovely and inspiring project!!"

HOW FIT YOU NEED TO BE.
Source: https://caminolovers.com/how-fit-do-you-need-to-be-to-walk-the-camino/#Some_training_back_home_won%E2%80%99t_hurt
* Walk for 1-2 hours a day, ideally many days in a row (just like you’d do on the Camino), with small backpack on. In an ideal case you should include some hills in your walk, simply because you will cover some elevation on the Camino.
* Go for a longer hike once in a week, ideally in nature and with a backpack as heavy as your camino pack will be. Keep prolonging the distance progressively, instead of going for 20 miles on your very first walk.
* Any aerobic exercises make for a good Camino training. Think swimming, cycling in a low intensity, jogging, etc. At the end of the day, you should enjoy your training. If swimming isn’t your thing there’s no point in forcing it.

Flight from Santiago de Compostela on the morning of November 6th, I basically have to get there the day before.

## Wisdom
* For wet feet, keep a pair of dry socks handy and stuff your shoes with newspaper at night.
  "Expect a fair amount of mud, and have a plan for when you encounter it. Mine is to wear quick-drying trail runners, and to take off my socks and roll up my trouser-legs when I have to squelch through the deep sections."
* Keep cash on-hand (but not too much).
* Have water at all times, fill it up at every opportunity.
* Rest when you need to <3
* First day will be hard.
* Consider booking ahead for accommodation on the first few days.
* In case of bed races, arriving before 2pm should be okay. Otherwise, book ahead.
* Booking accommodation: https://www.gronze.com/camino-norte
* Routine: Wake up at 6-7am, walk, arrive, shower, then you're free for the day.
