<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Database partitioning is used to make databases more robust and more easily
scalable. This article covers the definition of partitioning and works through
an implementation in the Kotlin programming language. The example code can be
found on <a href="https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/DatabasePartitioningExamples">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h4>What is partitioning?</h4>
<p>To partition a database means to divide it into smaller parts that are independent
of each other, with each part storing a subset of the data in the database. These parts
are referred to as partitions, or shards. Partitions can be servers, or they can be
isolated processes on a single server, to name two possibilities.
</p>

<p>Here's a monolithic database, one without partitions. We can model it as a
simple box that we put data to and get data from.</p>

<p>Here's a partitioned database. It has a "frontend" that contains logic ("partitioning
logic") to determine which partition should serve a given PUT or GET request. </p>

    alt="partitioned database"
    class="centered"/>

<p>The partitioning logic must be consistent - if data is sent to partition P, then GET
requests for that data should also go to partition P.
</p>

<h4>Why bother?</h4>
<p>One benefit of partitioned databases is that if a partition breaks, you lose only
<code>1/n</code> of your data, where <code>n</code> is the number of partitions. The
partitions can be spread across multiple servers and network availability zones to further
improve availability.
</p>

<p>Another benefit is that partitioned databases can scale more
flexibly. A monolithic database runs on one server, so the only way
to scale is to buy a bigger server. With multiple partitions, you can upgrade your server
type OR add more servers, since the database can be backed by multiple servers.
(see:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling">
vertical and horizontal scaling</a>).
</p>

<p>Partitioning also improves performance of the database,
as partitions receive fewer requests and have less data to search through than a monolithic
database would.
</p>

<p>The downside of partitioning is that it introduces complexity and new failure modes.
TODO mention that we will go into more detail on this point later in the article.

TODO somewhere, mention that: serious databases should be distributed, which means they
should be partitioned. Otherwise, you'd better hope that the size of the database
doesn't catch up with Moore's Law.
</p>

<h4>How does the partitioning logic work?</h4>
<p>In simple implementations, the database frontend keeps a list
of partitions in the database. When it receives a request, the frontend
applies a hash function to some identifier associated with the data, such
as an ID or a name. The hash function outputs an integer. The frontend then
mods this integer value by the number of partitions in the list to get the index
of the partition that should store the data. We will look at a more concrete
example of this in the next section.
</p>

<h4>Worked example</h4>

<p>Let's say we are designing a database that can store the personal details of prisoners.
We plan for our software to be used in American prisons, so it must be highly scalable. One
way we can do this is by partitioning. TODO make this better.
</p>

<p>Every prisoner has a unique integer ID. Their personal details are encoded in the form
of a string. Here's a data class to represent the personal details.
</p>

{% highlight 'kotlin' %}
data class Prisoner(val id: Int, val details: String)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>TODO: have I explained the partition hash thing elsewhere?
</p>

<p>We want our database to be partitioned, so we need a function to calculate the partition
of prisoner details. For simplicity, we can use the ID of the prisoner as their partition hash.
In general, this is not a good idea, because the identifier might not necessarily result in a good
distribution of prisoner details across the partitions. If the beaurocrat in charge of
assigning prisoner IDs has a fetish for multiples of 4, and we have 4 partitions in the
database, then all prisoner details will go to the partition at index 4k % 4 = 0.
</p>

{% highlight 'kotlin' %}
fun partitionHash(prisoner: Prisoner): Int = partitionHash(prisoner.id)
fun partitionHash(id: Int): Int = id
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Let's try out our <code>partitionHash()</code> function on a prisoner named
Jeffrey.</p>

{% highlight 'kotlin' %}
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val jeffrey = Prisoner(7, "Name=Jeffrey,Age=5")
    val numPartitions = 4
    println(partitionHash(jeffrey))
    println(partitionHash(jeffrey) % numPartitions)
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here's the output:</p>

<pre>
7
3
</pre>

<p>Jeffrey's prisoner details have a partition hash of 7, the same as his ID. If we
send his details to a database with 4 partitions, the details will be stored in the partition
at index 7 % 4 = 3.</p>

<p>Now for the database. First, we define the interface of a partition. We can put
prisoner data into a partition, and, using the prisoner ID, get that data back out.</p>

{% highlight 'kotlin' %}
interface Partition {

    fun put(prisoner: Prisoner)
    fun get(id: Int): Prisoner
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>At the lowest level of the database, we need partitions that are not subdivided
any further and that actually store the data.
</p>

{% highlight 'kotlin' %}
class IndivisiblePartition: Partition {

    private val prisoners: MutableMap<Int, Prisoner> = mutableMapOf()

    override fun put(prisoner: Prisoner) {
        prisoners[prisoner.id] = prisoner
    }

    override fun get(id: Int): Prisoner {
        return prisoners[id] ?: throw RuntimeException()
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>We can define the database itself as an implementation of the partition interface,
because we can also put and get prisoner details from the database. It consists of several
smaller partitions. We use the partition hash of prisoner details, modulo the number of
partitions in the database, to figure out which partition we should assign
prisoner details to.</p>

{% highlight 'kotlin' %}
class Database(private val numPartitions: Int): Partition {

    private val partitions: List<Partition> = List(numPartitions) {
        IndivisiblePartition()
    }

    override fun put(prisoner: Prisoner) {
        getPartition(partitionHash(prisoner)).put(prisoner)
    }

    override fun get(id: Int): Prisoner {
        return getPartition(partitionHash(id)).get(id)
    }

    private fun getPartition(partitionHash: Int): Partition {
        return partitions[partitionHash % numPartitions]
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To assess the quality of our partitioning algorithm, we should
consider whether prisoner data is distributed evenly
across the partitions of the database. We don't want any partitions to store
significantly more data than any other partitions, because they might fill up.
For testing, we can generate 1,000,000 prisoners, put their details in the database
and see what the distribution looks like.</p>

{% highlight 'kotlin' %}
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val numPartitions = 7
    val database = Database(numPartitions)

    val prisoners = 1000000
    for (id in 1..prisoners) {
        database.put(Prisoner(id, "Name=Foo,Age=30"))
    }

    // min & max methods omitted.
    println("Min partition size: ${database.minPartitionSize()}")
    println("Max partition size: ${database.maxPartitionSize()}")
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here's the output:</p>

<pre>
Min partition size: 142857
Max partition size: 142858
</pre>

<p>Prisoner details are perfectly distributed across the partitions of
the database. Using prisoner ID as the partition hash has worked well
in this case.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This is too Wall of Texty, break it up.
</p>

<p>Partitioning has benefits for the availability and scalability of a database, and
our example has shown that it is easy to implement. There are a few subtleties that
have not been considered, however. Changing the number of partitions in  a database
("repartitioning") is tricky, to say the least. The implementation of multi-layer
partitioning, where partitions have partitions (the first "layer" of partitions might
consist of database servers, the second layer might consist of processes on those servers),
has a surprising gotcha. And of course, it's unwise to use an identifier as a partition hash,
as it in no way guarantees that data will be well-distributed. These subtleties will be
considered in a follow-up article.
