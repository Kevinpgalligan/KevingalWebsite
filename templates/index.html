<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is where I (Kevin Galligan) keep my software and writing stuff. The writing is mostly computer-related. In recent times, I got a science degree and spent 3 years developing Java web services for some company. I've since returned to college in a misguided attempt to learn more maths.</p>
