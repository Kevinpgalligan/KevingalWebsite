<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Kevin Galligan. I was a software developer for a few years, now I study coding theory. This is where I keep my software and writing.</p>

<h3>Infrequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>Q: How can I contact you?</b></p>

<p>I'd be happy to hear from you at <a href="mailto:galligankevinp@gmail.com">galligankevinp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>Q: Does your stuff have a license?</b></p>

<p>All of the content on this site is under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">CC BY-NC license</a>. Basically, do what you want, but give me credit and don't try to sell it.</p>

<p><b>Q: What do you like to write about?</b></p>

<p>Here are the tags I've used on my blog, sorted by frequency.</p>

<p>{% for tag in tags %}<a href="/blog/tags/{{tag.name}}.html">{{tag.name}}</a> ({{tag.count}}) {% endfor %}</p>

<p><b>Q: Why doesn't your blog have comments?</b></p>

<p>It's easier to maintain a static site. All I have to do is upload the files to GitHub Pages and they're magically available to the world. Some day, I might set up a server to host comments.</p>

<p><b>Q: What's the story with the icon?</b></p>

<p>I needed an icon and drew something vaguely inspired by the Game of Life. Here it is in action.</p>

<img class="centered" alt="The site's icon, animated" src="/static/img/life.gif">

<p><b>Q: Which blogs do you like?</b></p>
<p><a href="https://twobithistory.org/">Two-Bit History</a>. It gets into the gritty technical details of computer history. It's terribly upsetting when writers of popular history make vague allusions to technical beans rather than spilling them. Probably because they don't understand the beans. I'm looking at you, Steven "HTML is a programming language" Levy.</p>

<p>I'm also a fan of <a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a>. She covers topics like networking and kernel programming in a fun and accessible way.</p>

<p><b>Q: Which software do you use?</b></p>

<p>Linux Mint, Python, C/C++ (aspirational), Common Lisp, vim, Emacs, tmux, Firefox, Thunderbird (email, calendar, RSS).</p>
