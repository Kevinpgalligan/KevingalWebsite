<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Kevin Galligan. This is where I keep my software and writing stuff. I like to write about technology, programming, books, maths, and whatever else takes my fancy.</p>

<p>I was a software developer for 3 years, working on Java web services. Now I'm back in college, where I do research on coding theory and the occasional bit of Buzzword Learning (BLâ„¢).</p>

<h4>Infrequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p><b>Q:</b> How can I contact you?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> <a href="mailto:galligankevinp@gmail.com">galligankevinp@gmail.com</a> or Twitter. I like receiving emails!</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Does your stuff have a license?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/"><img alt="CC BY-NC license" src="/static/img/cc-license.png"></a>. Basically, do what you want, but give me credit and don't try to sell it.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Why does this website look like it was beaten with a lead pipe, lit on fire, and run over by an 18-wheeler truck?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> <a href="https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/KevingalWebsite">See for yourself</a>.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What software do you use?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> Linux Mint (it just works), Python (for research), C++ (for pain), Common Lisp (for pleasure), vim (text editing, still discovering all the tricks), tmux (terminal tabs), Emacs (for Common Lisp programming), Firefox (I like privacy), Thunderbird (email and RSS).</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Why doesn't your blog have comments?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> It's easier to maintain a static site. All I have to do is upload the files to GitHub Pages and they're magically available to the world. Some day, I might set up a server to host comments, but until then I'll delegate that job to news aggregator sites.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Do you spy on me?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> Nope. I removed Google Analytics in order to preserve your privacy. You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What's the story with the icon?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> I needed an icon and drew something vaguely inspired by the Game of Life. It now seems cold and impersonal, but what can you do. Here it is, animated as a Game of Life state.</p>
