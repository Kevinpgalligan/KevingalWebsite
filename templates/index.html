<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Kevin Galligan! This place hosts my blog, an index of my projects, and some free web applications. On the blog, I like to write about programming, math, life experiences, and anything else that takes my fancy. In this life, I've been a software developer and a PhD student. My doctoral research was about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">error correction decoding algorithms</a>.</p>

<h3>Infrequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>Q: Does your stuff have a license?</b></p>

<p>All of the content on this site is under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">CC BY-NC license</a>. Basically, do what you want, but give me credit and don't try to sell it.</p>

<p><b>Q: Why doesn't your blog have comments?</b></p>

<p>It's easier to maintain a static site. All I have to do is upload the files to GitHub Pages and they're magically available to the world. I might eventually set up a server to host comments.</p>

<p><b>Q: What's the story with the icon?</b></p>

<p>I needed an icon and drew something vaguely inspired by the Game of Life. This is what happens when you plug it into the Game of Life.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mastodon.ie/@kevingal">Mastodon</a> for updates on what I'm doing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20359763-kevin-galligan">Goodreads</a> for logging books.</li>

<li><a href="https://lichess.org/@/kpgiskpg">Lichess</a> for playing chess.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Q: Which software do you use?</b></p>
<p>Linux Mint, Python, C/C++, Common Lisp, vim, Emacs, tmux, Firefox, Thunderbird (email, calendar, RSS).</p>

<p><b>Q: What was your PhD about?</b></p>
<p>When data is sent over the Internet, it has to travel through noisy communication channels like cables. Along the way, it gets corrupted by physical phenomena like earthquakes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ex7uTQf4bQ">sharks</a>, and more mundane things like faulty routers. To overcome this, the computer people use a technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">error correction codes</a>, which adds redundancy to a message that can then be used by specialised algorithms to identify and fix the errors. I was working on those algorithms.</p>

<p>An emoji example! You take your data 📚, encode it using a repetition code 📚📚📚, send it through a communication channel 🌐, the channel introduces errors 📚❌📚, and the receiver uses a decoding algorithm to identify the errors and recover the original message 📚.</p>

<p><b>Q: What have people said about you?</b></p>
<p><i>You're a calming presence</i> - a colleague.</p>
<p><i>The author is lacking in many respects</i> - an insightful HackerNews commenter.</p>
<p><i>At least I won't be remembered as a coward</i> - a brave internet user.</p>
