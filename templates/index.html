<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Kevin Galligan. I was a software developer for a few years, then I quit to go back to university. I now study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">error correction codes</a>. This is where I keep my software and writing.</p>

<h3>Infrequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>Q: How can I contact you?</b></p>

<p>I like receiving emails: <a href="mailto:galligankevinp@gmail.com">galligankevinp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>Q: Does your stuff have a license?</b></p>

<p>All of the content on this site is under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">CC BY-NC license</a>. Basically, do what you want, but give me credit and don't try to sell it.</p>

<p><b>Q: What do you like to write about?</b></p>

<p>It's kinda difficult to summarise, so here are the tags I've used on my blog.</p>

<p>{% for tag in tags %}<a href="{{url_for('tag', name=tag.name)}}">{{tag.name}}</a> ({{tag.count}}) {% endfor %}</p>

<p><b>Q: Why doesn't your blog have comments?</b></p>

<p>It's easier to maintain a static site. All I have to do is upload the files to GitHub Pages and they're magically available to the world. I might eventually set up a server to host comments.</p>

<p><b>Q: What's the story with the icon?</b></p>

<p>I needed an icon and drew something vaguely inspired by the Game of Life. This is what happens when you plug it into the Game of Life.</p>

<img class="centered" alt="The site's icon, animated" src="/static/img/life.gif">

<p><b>Q: Which software do you use?</b></p>

<p>Linux Mint, Python, C/C++ (aspirational), Common Lisp, vim, Emacs, tmux, Firefox, Thunderbird (email, calendar, RSS).</p>
