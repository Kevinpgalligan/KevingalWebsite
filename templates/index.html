<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Kevin Galligan. I like writing and making software. My writing tends to be about technology, programming, books, maths, and whatever else takes my fancy. I usually develop software to solve a problem I have or for entertainment. Fun facts: I'm Irish, I used to be a software developer, and now I'm back at college to do research on coding theory.</p>

<p>My email address is <a href="mailto:galligankevinp@gmail.com">galligankevinp@gmail.com</a>. I like receiving emails!</p>

<h3>Infrequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>Q: Why doesn't your blog have comments?</b></p>

<p><b>A:</b> It's easier to maintain a static site. All I have to do is upload the files to GitHub Pages and they're magically available to the world. Some day, I might set up a server to host comments, but until then I'll delegate that job to news aggregator sites.</p>

<p><b>Q: Do you spy on me?</b></p>

<p><b>A:</b> Nope. I removed Google Analytics in order to preserve your privacy. You're welcome.</p>

<p><b>Q: What's the story with the icon?</b></p>

<p><b>A:</b> I needed an icon and drew something vaguely inspired by the Game of Life. It now seems cold and impersonal, but what can you do. Here it is in the Game of Life.</p>

<p><b>Q: What software do you use?</b></p>

<p><b>A:</b> Linux Mint (it just works), Python (for research), C++ (for pain), Common Lisp (for pleasure), vim (text editing, still discovering all the tricks), tmux (terminal tabs), Emacs (for Common Lisp programming), Firefox (I like privacy), Thunderbird (email and RSS).</p>
