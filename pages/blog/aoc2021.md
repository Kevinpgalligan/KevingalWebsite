I got bitten quite badly by [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), and ended up solving all the problems in Common Lisp. In case you don't know, Advent of Code is a programming competition where a new problem is released every day in the lead-up to Christmas, just like an advent calendar.

### Problem Review
Here are my linecounts! 

INSERT PICTURE HERE

Commentary on the problems:

* Some copy/pasted code between days. Most notably, CL doesn't come with a split function like Python! This could easily be remedied by having a utilities library. Or using external libraries. If you're taking it seriously, you really wannamake things as convenient as possible (like the ints function).
* I overengineered day 17 (projectile), which basically turned into a mini equation solver / projectiles / engineering library. Useful to have that range code, though.
* Graph visualisation (can't remember which day).

### Other Observations
* Data formats are useful to know (HTML, graphviz, that raytracing one).
* More generally: the toolbelt analogy.
* Competitive programming (link to betaveros; confirmed my ideas about what you would have to do to be Super Competitive, lots of practice and autodownload and utilities library)
