title: Calculate Interval Size With This 1 Weird Trick! Mathematicians HATE It!
date: 2019-04-22

If you're weirdly obsessed with tracking the number of days until your birthday, or you're a programmer and want to avoid off-by-1 errors when calculating the number of elements in an array between two indices, then this article will be useful for you.

It might seem like a trivial problem at first. Why, you just subtract the bigger date from the smaller date and Bob is your creepy uncle! My birthday is on April 28th and today is April 3rd, therefore the number of days until my birthday is `28 - 3 = 25`. *TODO however, if you try to play with inclusivity of the bounds, it's easy to make an off-by-1 error, so we try to find a way to calculate this with absolute certainty.*

There is actually a simple rule for figuring out the number of days between particular dates, and you can modify it slightly depending on whether you want to include the start date and/or the end date in your count. *TODO revise this paragraph*

*TODO describe the rule, possibly include diagrams.*

*TODO refer to sublist, makes sense to use inclusive/exclusive.*

You should now be able to count the number of days until your birthday with full confidence, and perhaps more usefully, avoid annoying off-by-1 errors in your programming. Happy counting!
