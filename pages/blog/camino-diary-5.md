### Day 20, Friday, October 27th 2023, Mondoñedo (19.37km, 492.08km total)
As I left, Nicole pointedly reminded me where to find the donation box. More like "coercion" box, amirite? I'd already left some money, anyway. Reading reviews for Granja de Calor, there seemed to be a lot of people complaining about how shabby the place was. I guess that's why they made it a donativo albergue. They couldn't be held to the same standards as other albergues if people got to stay there for free and donate whatever they wanted... right??? Regardless, I'd enjoyed hearing their story and the food had been tasty.

The rest of the day: boredom, monotony, and the ascension and descension of hilly forested trails. Every day the landscape reminded me more of Ireland. Patchwork farms and vivid green vegetation.

I sheltered under a bus stop during a sudden downpour and watched chess videos on my phone. Popped in to a café for a snack and a drink, where there were 4 old guys speaking *gallego* (the local language of Galicia). It sounded like strongly accented Spanish, with a sprinkling of Portuguese, but I couldn't understand it at all. I stopped for lunch in Lourenzá, then continued on until Mondoñedo. My accommodation, Hotel Padornelo, was basic but functional, and cost €30 for the night. A kind lady checked me in and complimented my Spanish, even though I'd probably only said a few stock phrases to navigate our interaction. For food, I went to a lively bar that was a short walk away in the town. I had patatas bravas, croquettes and red wine.

### Day 21, Saturday, October 28th, Gontán (15.43km, 507.51km total)
An ascent of 700m, and the wind was very strong and annoying. Wind turbines everywhere. I left late in the morning, feeling bored and low in motivation. I hoped it was a phase and that my enthusiasm would return soon. Perhaps it was a consequence of the relative isolation I'd experienced the day before.

I encountered Nico, the giant bearded Frenchman who could often be found talking and laughing to himself. We always exchanged a friendly greeting, despite the language barrier. He had made efforts to speak to me in French, but I was only ever able to pick up a word or two. French would probably be the most useful language to know on the Camino after Spanish and English, since French people seemed to be the largest group of monolinguals to walk it.

It was a short segment, ending in Gontán, and yet, due to my lack of motivation, I was relieved to be finished for the day. I was lucky to miss a downpour that started shortly after I arrived. Among the people in my albergue were Nico, Sonia and Mira (the Ukrainians), Contain (my best attempt to transcribe his French name), and a Spanish man who humblebragged about how far he was walking each day. I ate a tortilla sandwich at a typical Spanish bar, and spent the rest of the evening talking to the other pilgrims. I finally learned a bit more about the life situation of Sonia and Mira. Sonia had fled Ukraine at the beginning of the war and was now living in Berlin. Mira had also fled and was somehow involved in acting or the arts.

### Day 22, Sunday, October 29th, Vilalba (21.6km, 529.11km total)
Flat terrain, a little muddy but nothing unpassable. My ankle wasn't hurting so much anymore, but even so it still felt fragile and I was hesitant to walk on it too fast or for too long. I met some new people: Robert (from Canada), Mary (from Las Vegas), and Chris and Monica (a Swiss couple I remembered seeing earlier in the trip, perhaps at Padre Ernesto's albergue). Robert and I went for tea on arriving at Vilalba. He was a 70-year-old carpenter from Vancouver. Since my sister was living there and I'd gone to visit her a few times, I knew a bit about the place. He said he'd grown up in Vancouver before it had blown up in size, population, and expensiveness. His brother had been a victim of the opioid crisis in North America, like many others.

We also spoke of the Palestine-Israel conflict. Robert believed that it was a religious conflict, fuelled by extremists on both sides. Even then, ignorant as I was about the history of Palestine, I didn't buy that narrative. People often (mistakenly) said the same thing about the conflict in Northern Ireland: Catholics and Protestants, unable to reconcile over the minute doctrinal differences in their religions! Of course, that completely glosses over the colonial roots of these conflicts.

<!-- ✨ HISTORICAL TANGENT ✨: Protestants in Northern Ireland are generally the descendents of colonial settlers, while Catholics tend to be native Irish. "Catholic" and "Protestant" are merely convenient labels for those groups, each of which have distinct histories, traditions, and relations with the United Kingdom (UK). When Ireland gained its independence in 1921/1922, Northern Ireland was excluded and remained part of the UK because it had been more heavily colonised than the south. In the 1960s, Protestants dominated positions of power in Northern Ireland, as well as the economy and the police force. Election boundaries were manipulated to exclude Catholics. When a civil rights movement was kicked off by Catholics, inspired by the one in the United States, there was a hostile reaction from the Protestant establishment, who feared that their position of power - and their economically valuable connection to the UK - was under threat. This was the genesis of The Troubles, a period of violent conflict (consisting of shootings, bombings, kidnappings, massacres, and British Army occupation) that would last 30-40 years. All that to say that categorising The Troubles as a religious conflict is reductive and, in my opinion, plain wrong. The same goes for Palestine-Israel, which can be better understood as a conflict between coloniser and colonised. -->

After tea, I went to my albergue, As Pedreiras, which turned out to be really nice. It was warm, there was a guitar, and there were cool maps hanging from the wall. Everyone was given their own towel, sheets and pillow. I somehow ended up playing a mini-concert with one of the owners of the albergue, who pulled out a second guitar from somewhere. We played a few songs that he had sheet music for: *La flaca*, *Let It Be*, *Mariposa traicionera*, and *El sonido de silencio* (The Sound of Silence). By the end, my hands were trembling from the hunger, since all the supermarkets were closed on Sundays and I hadn't been able to buy food anywhere. I rushed to find a restaurant, and ended up at A Taberna, where I gorged myself on spaghetti with tomato sauce, padrón peppers, bread, *tarta de abuela* (grandma's tart), and a caña.

At the albergue were all the aforementioned pilgrims, as well as Ivano (the "citizen of the world"), the boastful Spaniard (who turned out to be all right, he was from Granada), a Dutch guy called Jeron (probably a transcription error), and a German guy. The German guy was walking a lot every day, about 40km. He was walking around barefoot, so the boastful Spaniard asked me to tell him that he should put on socks because of the risk of spreading fungal infections. I acted as a translator between the two for a few minutes, which was always a fun experience. I then continued talking to the German guy in a mix of English and half-remembered German from school. It was a novelty to encounter a German who didn't speak English at a high level. That said, his English was still a lot better than my German.

I read a bit and watched some chess/Stratego videos on my phone before bed. My progress with *Los detectives salvajes* was slow. Such a long book, with so very little happening in it.

### Day 23, Monday, October 30th, A Lagoa (40km, 569.11km total)
I left Vilalba fairly late, after having breakfast in a cafetería. It was a cold morning, and I could see my own breath, but my enthusiasm had been renewed, probably from all the socialising I'd done the day before. I also hadn't been getting enough sleep, so it must've helped to get a reasonably good rest.

It was an intense day, emotionally speaking. I was walking past some houses in the countryside when I heard a panicked cry for help from someone's garden. I looked around and caught a glimpse of bright red. It was an old lady lying on the ground with blood on her face. I ran over to her. She'd fallen down the stairs at the side of her house. I couldn't lift her up; she said her head was sore, and it hurt her to move, so I didn't want to apply too much force in moving her in case it did more damage. There was blood dripping from a gash above her mouth. I couldn't tell if she had broken a bone. She also seemed confused, as when I asked if she lived with anyone and where her family was her answers seemed to vary between her family living with her, in Bilbao, or in Vilalba. (Or maybe I was failing to understand her with my crappy Spanish).

I wasn't sure what to do. I tried to support her back so she wasn't just lying there on the ground. She didn't want me to call the emergency services, for some reason - maybe in denial of how serious the situation was? Or worried that they'd take her away from her home? She kept trying to give me money, even though I'd been pretty useless up to that point. I asked her if she had neighbours and went in the direction she pointed to find them.

By this point, I was full of adrenaline and my mind was completely focused on resolving the situation. Next door, I found an elderly couple who seemed to be farmers. Their dog let it be known that my presence wasn't appreciated. The neighbours themselves, when I told them what had happened, said that they didn't want to get involved. They seemed to have fallen out with the injured woman. I at least managed to extract from them the street address and the woman's name. The wife let out a stream of curse words - not directed at me, she just seemed really stressed.

Disgusted by their unwillingness to help, I returned to the injured woman, and after another attempt to convince her that we should call the emergency services, I just went ahead and did it. I knew the European-wide emergency number was 112. This was my first time calling it. I was passed from person to person as they narrowed down where I was and what the problem was. It took me a while to explain what had happened and exactly where the house was located. It didn't help that my phone's GPS was imprecise in that area.

After the call, I was joined by a French couple who were passing by on their Camino. They spoke neither English nor Spanish, but they were at least able to offer their emotional support, and even went in search of more neighbours, only to find the same useless ones that I'd encountered earlier. Throughout the ordeal, I was breathing heavily and felt like I was in fight or flight mode.

Eventually, three female paramedics arrived in an ambulance and attended to the injured woman. She began to cry as they started taking care of her. She gave me a key to her house and asked me to make sure the front door was locked. After that, with the situation under control, I had a moment to breathe, and started to cry myself. I was crying from the shock, the relief, and the sadness of the situation - this woman was living by herself, senile, with seemingly no family taking care of her, and alienated from her neighbours.

When the paramedics assured me that everything was okay, I left. I was so frazzled that I neglected to say goodbye to the woman. Later, I also regretted that I hadn't told off the neighbours for their ugly behaviour.

I walked quickly, still feeling emotional. I passed the French couple, who had left a minute or so before me. They shared a sympathetic look and asked if I was okay. For the second time on the Camino, I saw a dead badger on the side of the road. As I walked, I reflected on what had happened and on some associated coincidences. I was reminded of the painting in Padre Ernesto's albergue, which depicted pilgrims helping a person in need - the injured woman and I had been in the same pose, with her lying on the ground and me crouched at her side supporting her back! I'd also wondered to myself, while walking through the remote countryside, what would happen if I encountered an injured person. And a week or so previously, I'd seen a dog wandering about with a leash trailing behind it, and I'd had the morbid thought that maybe its owner had collapsed somewhere while bringing it for a walk.

I arrived at Baamonde, where I found Ivano and Jean (a French guy from the albergue in Vilalba). I told them about my dramatic experience, then bought some provisions at a shop there, before setting out with them towards an albergue called A Lagoa, which was about 13km ahead. I'd wanted to do a shorter segment (31km vs 40km), but the nearer albergue was closed, A&W had recommended A Lagoa to me (they'd stayed there 2 days previously), and Ivano and Jean turned out to be good company. We walked through deciduous forests, and passed by a church from the 16th century. I got a blister on one of my toes, but it barely hurt and it was a while before I even noticed it.

We arrived at A Lagoa and met the kind host that A&W had told me about. Many pilgrims I'd recently encountered were already there: Nico, Robert (the Canadian), Mary (the *estadounidense*), and Monica and Chris (the Swiss couple). We ate well: the host's mother made us soup, pasta, and *tarta de Santiago* (I think it's an almond cake?). I had a few glasses of a local wine, and they gave us some slices of leftover birthday cake, which A&W had also gotten to experience. I told my new pals the story of the emergency situation. Monica in particular showed me a lot of empathy, and seemed to understand how difficult it had been for me, and from that point I felt very fond of her. The accommodation was comfortable.

### Day 24, Tuesday, October 31st, Sobrado dos Monxes (27.29km, 596.4km total)
I left the albergue around 8am. My destination for the day was Sobrado dos Monxes, and the monastery there that offered accommodation for pilgrims. I walked alone at first, but encountered other pilgrims along the way. I stopped to chat with Mary, Monica, Chris and Robert in a café. This segment wasn't challenging, but I did have to cross a giant muddy puddle, in the process of which my shoes and socks got soaked. I just hoped there wasn't any *caca de vaca* (cow shit) in there. Afterwards, I took off my socks to squeeze the brown water out of them. Yuck.

Industrial farms. Grey buildings with no windows - if light couldn't enter, then the day-and-night cycle of the animals could be controlled, and in that way, chickens, for example, could be manipulated to produce more eggs. Grain silos for feeding them. I didn't want to imagine what was inside the grey buildings. Thousands and thousands of suffering animals. Stressed, crowded together, never seeing the sun, sleeping on their own faeces. Selectively bred for farming, at the expense of their physical health. Spain was famous for its pig meat, but I never saw a single pig on the entire Camino.

Sobrado. It was situated beside an artificial lake that was 100s of years old. Very pretty, but I didn't spend too long admiring it because a storm was about to break out. I arrived at the monastery and was greeted by an English monk called Laurence. He checked in me and the other pilgrims who'd arrived around the same time - Monica, Chris and Robert. Laurence was a funny character, his remarks dripped with irony and he didn't seem to suffer fools. He'd adopted an affectionate orphan cat that he called Maximilian.

More about Monica and Chris. Monica was a kindergarten teacher, Chris was an electrician. Now they were working half-time, at their pleasure. They'd been vegetarians for 30 years, and for 20 of those years they'd owned an organic food shop. Their son had done the Northern Way when he was only 18, though he did find it rough at the start.

In the evening, I went for some cañas with Robert. We saw a man playing a slot machine in the corner, it was making him very angry. I struck up conversation with some Spanish people who were playing cards at another table. They were playing [chinchón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinch%C3%B3n_(card_game)), a matching game that seemed to be similar to gin rummy and mahjong. Two of them turned out to be from Bilbao and were visiting their friends in Sobrado. Later, Robert and I got dinner at a bar.

I had to explain to Ivano that Irish people aren't British. I couldn't complain, though, since I'd accidentally called Robert an *estadounidense*.

That night, I went to bed around 11pm and followed the usual procedure of filling out my diary with the day's events, surrounded by the sound of snoring and pattering rain. I was conscious that the words I was writing were unable to transmit even one-hundredth of the experience of being there. I couldn't truly capture the sights, the sounds, the smells, the feelings, and countless forgotten anecdotes. I would have to accept the limitations of my words, and allow my reader's imagination to fill in the rest.

More about the monk, Laurence. During the check-in, he complained to us good-humouredly, and I enjoyed his wit. Apparently, on receiving his assignment to Sobrado, his superiors had told him "you're English, so we're sending you there". He'd been at the Sobrado monastery since 2009, so 14 years. Before that, he'd spent many years in Italy. He spoke French and was able to communicate with Nico. An interesting character indeed. He'd left us old newspapers to dry out our shoes, among which I found a recent edition of El País that I decided to bring with me.
