title: Did The Beatles really love "you"?
date: 2019-10-14
draft: yes

Browsing the [Wikipedia page of Lennon-McCartney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon–McCartney), the virtuoso song-writing duo of The Beatles, a fun fact caught my interest.

> Author David Rowley points out that at least half of all Lennon–McCartney lyrics have the words "you" and/or "your" in the first line.

This refers to page 3 of the book *Help! 50 Songwriting, Recording and Career Tips used by the Beatles*, which suggests that song-writers should put the word "you" in the first line of their lyrics:

> Around half of all Lennon-McCartney lyrics use the magic songwriting words 'you or 'your' in the first line.

> These words, especially when used with the words 'I' or 'me', allow the listener to imagine that the song is about them and allow the listener to imagine that they are singing the song to another person.

> The opening words of the following songs are all addressed directly to the listener. 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', 'We can Work It Out', 'Taxman', [...]. Indeed, on some of these songs it sounds as if the Beatles wrote the lyrics as though they were having a conversation with their listener.

This brings several **incredibly important** questions to mind.

* How many Beatles songs refer to "you" in the first line, exactly?
* How does this compare to the you-rate of other musicians?
* Is there actually a correlation between chart success and the inclusion of "you" in the first line of a song, or was David Rowley blowing hot steam out of his ass?

This post will answer these questions.

### How many Lennon-McCartney songs are addressed to "you"?
* Studio albums from core catalogue (as per wiki) were scraped (refer to scraping script).
* Instrumental songs removed, leaving 183.
* Non-Lennon-McCartney songs removed, leaving N.
* Analysis done to show X% have "you" in first line, Y% have "you" somewhere in the lyrics (refer to script).
* Style note: put the percentages (and possibly other numbers) in bold.
* HENCE, whatsisface is full of shit.

What percentage of songs have "you" or "your" in the first line.

Other thing to consider: proportion of you's and your's vs his, her, he, she, they, theirs, it, its. This might be a more accurate measure of whether they're directly addressing the reader.

Also, careful of you're, yours.

### Comparing to other musicians
Contemporary, before, after.

Might just cut this shit.

### Chart success and you
Scrape lyrics for songs from a few years from around the time that the Beatles were active.

Correlation between "you" and chart success?

### Conclusion
Is it a valid tip?
