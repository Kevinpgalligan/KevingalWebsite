title: Did The Beatles really love "you"?
date: 2019-10-14

Browsing the [Wikipedia page of Lennon-McCartney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon–McCartney), the virtuoso song-writing duo of Beatles fame, a fun fact caught my interest.

> Author David Rowley points out that at least half of all Lennon–McCartney lyrics have the words "you" and/or "your" in the first line.

This refers to page 3 of the book *Help! 50 Songwriting, Recording and Career Tips used by the Beatles*, which suggests that song-writers should put the word "you" in the first line of their lyrics:

> Around half of all Lennon-McCartney lyrics use the magic songwriting words 'you or 'your' in the first line.

> These words, especially when used with the words 'I' or 'me', allow the listener to imagine that the song is about them and allow the listener to imagine that they are singing the song to another person.

> The opening words of the following songs are all addressed directly to the listener. 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', 'We can Work It Out', 'Taxman', [...]. Indeed, on some of these songs it sounds as if the Beatles wrote the lyrics as though they were having a conversation with their listener.

This brings several **incredibly important** questions to mind. TODO make joke about unquantified statement

* How many Beatles songs refer to "you" in the first line, exactly?
* How does this compare to the you-rate of other musicians?
* Is there actually a correlation between chart success and the inclusion of "you" in the first line of a song, or was David Rowley blowing hot steam out of his ass?

This post will answer these questions.

### How many Lennon-McCartney songs are addressed to "you"?
To address this question, I wrote a script (TODO include link to script) to download the lyrics of all of the songs from the Beatles' "core catalogue" studio albums, [as described on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_discography#Studio_albums). Instrumental songs, cover songs and songs with exclusive writing credit assigned to Ringo Starr / George Harrison were removed manually. This left a total of 140 songs. While not covering the full ~180 songs published by Lennon-McCartney, it's a representative sample.

After doing some quick analysis (TODO include link to the script), it was found that **30%** of the songs had "you" (or "your") in the first line. This is quite a bit short of "around half", which was claimed by David Rowley. However, since **83%** of the songs contained "you" *somewhere* in the lyrics, I'm willing to give him a pass, and it shouldn't be controversial to say that Lennon-McCartney did, in fact, love "you".

It's still a stretch to go from that to including the use of the word "you" in a list of 50 song-writing commandments. To justify such a dictum (TODO bible-sounding stuff here, also replace the word "list"), you'd have to show that the use of "you" tends to correlate with more chart success. Even then, it would be difficult to prove that "you" is the *cause* of the success, but it's the least we can try.

TODO this section seems verbose and non-visual

### Comparing to other musicians
Contemporary, before, after.

Might just cut this shit.

### Chart success and you
Scrape lyrics for songs from a few years from around the time that the Beatles were active.

Correlation between "you" and chart success?

### Conclusion
Is it a valid tip?
