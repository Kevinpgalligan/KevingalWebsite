If everyone on Earth owned a copy of *A Short History of Nearly Everything*, and they stacked their copies one on top of the other, then that stack would touch the Moon<sup>1</sup>.

Actually, it would overshoot by thousands of kilometres, but I wanted to start this review with a Bill Bryson-esque analogy, and that's the best I could come up with.

Bill Bryson published his popular science book, *A Short History of Nearly Everything*, in 2003. In 400 pages, it attempts to answer all of the Big Questions that a curious resident of our planet might have, such as "What's the Universe?", "Where did we come from?", and "How do scientists know that the Earth weighs 6 million yottagrams?".

Bryson addresses these questions in the form of a story, which meanders from EARTH TO BLAH TO BLAH. GEOLOGY, ZOOLOGY, BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS, EVOLUTION, HISTORY OF SCIENCE. It's a lot to fit in 400 pages. Even just listing off the topics makes me feel a bit breathless. But Bryson something something, easy to read, gives an idea of things without getting bogged down in the details, dips briefly into the Standard Model (?) and its dozens of types of particles, but only to give an idea of how mind-bogglingly complex it is. And under no circumstances does he allow any large, scary numbers to sneak into the book. Well, almost. In his own words:

Bryson prefers to convey quantities by relatable analogies, such as BLAH. And to make it all go down easy, his writing is easy to read and funny. (Quote to back up the funny bit?). I guess that's how he managed to sell X copies.

THE HEROES OF THE STORY ARE WACKO SCIENTISTS.

* Cavendish (wouldn't talk to people).
* Newton (sticking metal spikes in his eye sockets).
* JB Haldane putting people in decompression chambers.
* Scientific community gets it wrong (one of the themes).

IMMINENT DESTRUCTION (volcano... meteor... cosmic radiation... ice age). Calendar analogy, our civilisation came about in a pocket of relative calm. These processes are happening at scales we can't comprehend, from the incredibly tiny to the incredibly large. Maybe some of the analogies should be brought in here, they're more appropriate. Humans are terrible (for the environment; we're also a big extinction event).

* Enlarge a cell to the size of a sphere that's half a mile in radius/diameter, it's packed full of basketballs and cars racing around. An extremely chaotic but productive factory.
* Stretch your arms out. File a bit off the nail off your middle finger. It's as if you had erased human history from the Universe. There's also the calendar analogy, seen in Carl Sagan's Cosmos.
* A4 sheet on the pavement beside the Empire State Building.
* Make the nucleus of an atom the size of a pea, then the whole thing is the size of a football stadium.

SOME THINGS ARE WRONG. SOME THINGS ARE OUT OF DATE. BUT THE KID DID OKAY. I LIKED THE ANALOGIES / HUMOUR AND I LEARNED SOME NEW THINGS.

* Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet.
* We now know that there's no such thing as "junk" DNA.
* Higgs Boson has been discovered.
* Some napkin estimates are out of whack (distance of Betelgeuse? Need to look up other people's comments on this).
* Bottom of church windows being thicker due to glass flowing over time.
* Einstein being an "average" student
* The Big Squeeze in old diving suits. Actually, that one's true (Mythbusers).

<small><sup>1</sup>The Moon is 384,400,000-ish metres from Earth; a page is roughly 0.00012 metres thick; there are 544 pages in A Short History of Nearly Everything; 384,400,000/(0.00012x544)=~6 billion copies. There are 7-8 billion people on Earth.</small>
