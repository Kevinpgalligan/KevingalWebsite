If everyone on Earth owned a copy of *A Short History of Nearly Everything*, and they stacked their copies one on top of the other, then that stack would touch the Moon<sup>1</sup>.

That's the sort of thought experiment you'll find in Bill Bryson's popular science book, *A Short History of Nearly Everything*, in which Bryson (BB for short) tackles all the Big Questions that might occur to a curious resident of our planet. Questions like:

* What's the Universe?
* Where Did We Come From?
* How Do Scientists Know That the Earth Weighs 6 Million Yottagrams?

There's a lot to cover in a history of the Universe, from quantum physics, to cell biology, to species extinction. BB, however, manages to arrange these large subjects into a somewhat coherent narrative, never getting too bogged down by details. He also purposefully avoids textbook-style science presentation. Instead of bombarding you with a dry list of facts, every fact comes with its own entertaining story: the dumb theories that came first, a short biography of the scientists involved, the ongoing uncertainty, and so on.

BB loves to write about eccentric scientists. While this does pander somewhat to the stereotype of the scientist as weird, reclusive genius, it makes for good reading. I enjoyed hearing about Isaac Newton's vision experiments, which included poking a metal needle around his eye socket and staring at the sun. By BB's account, Newton was also surprisingly coy with his research. It took an incidental encounter with Edmund Halley, one of his scientist peers, before he launched into writing his famous *Principia Mathematica* and introduced the world to gravity and calculus.

Henry Cavendish is another curious character. He carried out the first experiment to accurately measure the Earth's mass, using a contraption that looked a bit like a Rube Goldberg machine. BB writes:

> [...] he was particularly devoted to the weekly scientific soirÃ©es of the great naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. It was always made clear to the other guests that Cavendish was on no account to be approached or even looked at. Those who sought his views were advised to wander into his vicinity as if by accident and to talk as it were into vacancy. If their remarks were scientifically worthy they might receive a mumbled reply, but more often than not they would hear a peeved squeak (his voice appears to have been high pitched) and turn to find an actual vacancy and the sight of Cavendish fleeing for a more peaceful corner.

My favourite eccentric described in the book is J.B.S. Haldane, who conducted experiments to understand the dangers of deep-sea exploration. These rather dangerous experiments were conducted primarily in a decompression chamber that he dubbed "the pressure pot", and his test subjects included himself, his wife, and even a former prime minister of Spain.

> Sent on a simulated descent, his wife once had a fit that lasted thirteen minutes. When at last she stopped bouncing across the floor, she was helped to her feet and sent home to cook dinner.

Oxygen poisoning, collapsed lungs and burst eardrums were among the risks undertaken by his test subjects. But, on the topic of burst eardrums, Haldane hedged that...

> ...the drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat deaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social accomplishment.

You just can't find this level of entertainment in a textbook!

BB makes frequent use of analogies to convey scales that are outside the realm of human experience, such as the volume of an atom. There are no figures like "6 million yottagrams" here, thank you very much. BB says that an atom lying next to a line of 1 millimeter is like an A4 sheet of paper lying flat on the pavement beside the Empire State Building. This is one of at least 4 analogies based on the Empire State Building. Then, to demonstrate the atom's relative emptiness, he asks the reader to imagine inflating its nucleus to the size of a pea; to keep the scale consistent, you'd have to blow up the atom's shell to the size of a football stadium.

Another example, which you'll recognise if you've seen Carl Sagan's *Cosmos*, is the [Cosmic Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Calendar). The idea is to imagine the entire history of the Universe as a 365-day calendar. On that calendar, modern humans exist for only the last 10 minutes of December 31st.

Even science types are likely to discover some gaps in their knowledge. As for me, I was surprised at the number of possible uncontrollable events that could wipe humanity from existence: meteor collisions, supervolcanoes, massive bursts of radiation from space. These catastrophic processes happen on a regular basis. The catch, however, is that they're only regular on a planetary or universal timescale. BB relates a further analogy that might illustrate what I mean: lift your arms until they're horizontal to the ground and consider their span to be the entire history of the Universe. If someone now files a bit off the end of one of your fingers, it's equivalent to wiping humanity from existence. So even if civilisation-ending events happen regularly on that timescale, they're still REALLY unlikely to happen during a single human lifetime. Human extinction is most likely a danger for future generations to contend with, as long as we don't manufacture it ourselves.

*A Short History of Everything* isn't perfect. Science has advanced since the book's publication in 2003, outdating some of its information: Pluto has been demoted to the rank of dwarf planet, the existence of the Higgs Boson particle has been confirmed experimentally, and scientists now suspect that what they thought was "junk" DNA actually has a purpose. The book also contains information that's just plain wrong, like the myth that church windows are thicker at the bottom due to the gradual flow of glass. BB also gives credence to the popular myth that Albert Einstein was in any way an "average" student, when by Einstein's own account, he had mastered integral and differential calculus by the age of 14. There's obviously something seductive about the notion that there's a little Einstein buried deep inside all of us, if only we applied ourselves.

Most disgracefully, BB buys into the old sailor myth of divers literally being sucked up and squished into the helmet of their diving suits, a phenomenon known as The Squeeze. Of course, this is a ridiculous flight of fancy, probably fabricated by J.B.S. Haldane after he'd finished a particularly rough session in the pressure pot. It's absurd that BB could ever be taken in by such an obviously fake story<sup>2</sup>.

Anyone who fixates on these minor inaccuracies is missing the Universe for the atoms, however. I happily recommend *A Short History of Everything* to anyone with even a passing interest in science. It's packed full of fun anecdotes and visceral analogies. It might even teach you something.

<small><sup>1</sup>The Moon is 384,400,000-ish metres from Earth; a page is roughly 0.00012 metres thick; there are 544 pages in A Short History of Nearly Everything (including many pages of references); 384,400,000/(0.00012x544)=~6 billion copies would be required to touch the moon; and there are 7-8 billion people on Earth. So actually, the stack would overshoot by tens of thousands of kilometres, but that's the best Bill Bryson-esque analogy I could come up with.</small>

<small><sup>2</sup>Except, this phenomenon was actually proven in an episode of Mythbusters. They created a "meat man", sent him deep underwater in a diving suit, and cut off his air supply. The resulting pressure differential in his suit caused the meat man's entire body to be sucked up into his helmet. Yes, it was disgusting. Yes, it was  awesome. (Season 7, episode 19, "Dumpster Diving"). </small>
