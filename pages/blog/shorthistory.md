If you stacked 1000 copies of blah blah.

So goes Bill Bryson's *A Short History of Nearly Everything*, a popular science book published in the the early 00s.

Outline:

* What topics it touches on.
* How he tells the story. Analogies. Humour. Anecdotes about scientists.
* Wrong / out of date information.
* Themes.
* (In conclusion) Huge range of subject matter. I think it even touches on globalisation and how viruses can travel more easily (hello corona).

Topics:

* Where we are in the universe.
* How the universe was formed.
* How humans figured stuff out about the planet.
* How the Earth works (atmosphere, plates, rocks...uhhhhh).
* How life started (we don't know?).
* How life evolved.
* Diversity of life.
* ...need to review the chapter list.

Analogies:

* Enlarge a cell to the size of a sphere that's half a mile in radius/diameter, it's packed full of basketballs and cars racing around. An extremely chaotic but productive factory.
* Stretch your arms out. File a bit off the nail off your middle finger. It's as if you had erased human history from the Universe. There's also the calendar analogy, seen in Carl Sagan's Cosmos.
* A4 sheet on the pavement beside the Empire State Building.
* Make the nucleus of an atom the size of a pea, then the whole thing is the size of a football stadium.
* ...I'm sure there are more.

Wacko scientists:

* Cavendish (wouldn't talk to people).
* Newton (sticking metal spikes in his eye sockets).
* JB Haldane putting people in decompression chambers.

Themes:

* Scientific community gets it wrong.
* Humans are terrible (for the environment; we're also a big extinction event).
* The universe is an incredibly dangerous but slow-moving place. We could be wiped out by volcanos, meteors, ...
* Most things happen at scales we can't comprehend, from the insane variety of life, to the size of the universe, to tininess of cells.

Wrong / out of date info:

* Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet.
* We now know that there's no such thing as "junk" DNA.
* Higgs Boson has been discovered.
* Some napkin estimates are out of whack (distance of Betelgeuse? Need to look up other people's comments on this).
* Bottom of church windows being thicker due to glass flowing over time.
* Einstein being an "average" student
* The Big Squeeze in old diving suits. Actually, that one's true (Mythbusers).
