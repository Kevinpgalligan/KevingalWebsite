description: On the sharing of code.

Outside the idyllic bubble of open source software where nothing bad ever happens, there are communities where it's not standard behaviour to share your code. This is due to an affliction that I've taken to calling *codeshyness*.

There are several possible root causes that may underlie the syndrome of a codeshy person. In the generative art community, for instance, people [eagerly share](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/) the visual results of their programs but are extremely coy when it comes to sharing the programs themselves. Some of them are flouting their work on NFT websites and don't want to undermine the value of their work by allowing people to create infinite variations of it. Some of them don't want to give up their Top Secret Techniques, which are a source of Clout and Prestige. Some of them are self-conscious about their ugly code.

To all of these people, I say: *just share your damn code*. It's so self-evident to me that the sharing of code is a good thing. It's certainly not a bad thing. It enables others to learn from your work and to produce cool things of their own. You, in turn, can learn from them when they release their code, and the community advances as a whole rather than stagnating while individuals hoard knowledge for themselves.

- To the NFT people: if people are willing to pay for a concept as ridiculous as owning a copy of a digital image, then I doubt it'll make a difference if the source code is available. Hell, you could even include the source code as part of the NFT.
- Capitalist and propertarian mindset, reflective of proprietary software so I shouldn't be surprised.
- All working code is beautiful code. Sure, maybe it will reveal some of your ignorance or some pretentious code snobs will turn up their nose, but you also have the opportunity to learn and others have the opportunity to learn from you!

> I'll publish it later, it's in a rough state

No, publish it now! Later will never come.

Then there's academia. This will vary by field, but in the field I've been working in for the past 3+ years (channel coding), I have yet to encounter a single paper where the authors shared their research code. Much of this is probably due to precedent and academics being self-aware about how garbage their code is, but I'm sure there are some with less pure motives, such as not wanting any intrepid students to find a bug in their code and undermine their publication.

Again: *just share your damn code*. Are you trying to advance the state of research, or create an empire of intellectual property? It inhibits the scientific process because your results are much more difficult to reproduce. I've wasted a lot of time trying to reproduce people's results that could've been spent working on other things.

I'm a hypocrite, of course. I haven't published any of my 1000s of lines of research code. I expressed an interest to my supervisor in publishing my research code, but he wanted to go through the Proper Channels. The Proper Channels being the university's nightmare bureaucratic process / commercialisation department.

I acknowledge that my opinion is based on my values. I highly value the open sharing of ideas rather than restrictive commercial bullshit. It's valid for someone to value other things, but still: just share your F-ing code! Especially if you're a researcher.
