tags: phd

Having spent about 13% of my life to-date obtaining a PhD, I've decided to describe my experiences for the benefit of anyone who's curious about PhDs or is wondering whether to do one. I will point people to this post if they ever ask me questions such as:

* What's a PhD like?
* Should I do a PhD?
* (Something funny).

every PhD is different (supervisor, subject, etc)

something about how it's hard to understand some things without experiencing them yourself

#### my experience
cohort, 4 years, Ireland-specific stuff, stuff specific to my field, day to day life

#### nice things
sense of community, opportunity to learn new things, more doors are open, diverse skills (presenting, writing, researching), learn what research is

#### not so nice things
stressful w/ pressure to publish, isolating, everyone seems to have bad times during it, maybe everything challenging & worth doing is stressful most challenging bit isn't necessarily research, you don't get to spend your whole time learning, it's difficult to reproduce results & share your code, impostor syndrome, politics (Condo example), supervisor-dependent, financial aspect


#### A life in a graph
