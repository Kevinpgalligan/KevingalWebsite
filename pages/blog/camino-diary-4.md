### Day 15, Sunday, October 22nd, Cadavedo (30.5km, 387.9km total)
We left the albergue when it was still mostly dark out. Sergio and I happened to leave at the same time, but we separated when I took an Aurora-endorsed shortcut back to the main trail. I stopped in at a café, where other pilgrims I knew gradually filtered in: A&W, Mira the Ukrainian, Tony, Kobi and Sergio. In passing, I thought I heard a local Spaniard mutter "puto blanco" under his breath, which I think would translate to "white bastard"? If he was indeed referring to me, then the meaning was pretty clear. A refreshing change from hearing "Buen Camino" every day, anyway.

Aurora left her walking stick (a literal stick) behind in the café. I caught up with her to return it and we walked together once again. It was a challenging segment, with hard surfaces and lots of hills, but the scenery was worth it. We walked through forests and crossed over streams. Out of boredom, I picked up some fallen branches and hurled them like javelins. We all laughed when a bird made an indignant squawk just as one of these branches landed among the trees. The coastal landscapes of this segment were among the most beautiful I'd seen on the Camino up to that point.

We arrived, tired, at Cadavedo. I got a room in an albergue (Casa de Peregrinos Covi y Peter) with Sergio, Tony and Kobi. We went to a place called Casino Bar for food, where I had patatas bravas and a veggie burger. Ivano from Sicily joined us. I discovered that he'd done the Camino more than 20 times, and he'd been living outside Italy for so long that he barely considered himself Italian - more a "citizen of the world". Sergio bought shots for everyone. I overheard him and Tony discussing their respective divorces, and both men seemed to feel a lot of pain over it. I was curious to hear more about their experiences, but didn't want to intrude.

For the first time, the approach of Santiago came up in conversation. I felt sad at the prospect of reaching the end, which I guess was a sign of how much I was enjoying the experience, despite all the fretting I was doing over my injuries.

### Day 16, Monday, October 23rd 2023, Villapedre
I was the last one to leave the albergue. I noticed a few insect bites on my feet and hoped they weren't from bedbugs (*chinches*). Something about bedbugs has always creeped me out.

I stopped at a café to rest after about an hour of walking, and ordered a tortilla and a cup of black tea. I'd grown to look forward to these tea breaks, and the sanctuary of a warm cuppa. Sergio, Kobi, and A&W caught up with me before long. I continued on with A&W to Luarca, the stop suggested by the Buen Camino app. I wanted to keep walking with them, so we carried on to Villapedre, which was almost twice the distance as Luarca. It wasn't as tough as the day before, but my left foot did start to hurt by the end. We talked about religion, drugs, and life plans.

When I was standing or walking, my ankle didn't seem to hurt so much. But it was definitely still swollen and tended to be sore in the mornings. I hoped it wasn't a serious injury.

Luarca was pretty. A circular port filled with boats, a strong tide, a grey sea, and colourful buildings laid out in concentric rings around the port.

In Villapedre I checked into the hotel El Pinar. I felt conscious of the privilege I had in being able to stay in hotels whenever I wanted some comfort and privacy. Of course, there were levels of privilege. Those of us walking the Camino could afford the travel to Spain, the equipment, and the accommodation. Meanwhile, there were Palestinians being murdered every day, while I was preoccupied by trivialities like insect bites and a swollen ankle.

I spent the evening in bed, keeping my ankle elevated, watching trashy TV, and eating pizza. One of the shows was El Cazador (The Hunter), the Spanish equivalent of The Chase. I was humbled by a comedy show where I couldn't understand a single word the comedians were saying.

### Day 17, Tuesday, October 24th
I waited until it stopped raining before leaving the hotel, but the wind was still so strong that it nearly knocked me over a few times.

While passing through Piñera, the town where A&W and some other pilgrims I knew had stayed the night before, I was greeted by a local man called Jose-Luis. He liked to talk with passing pilgrims and take their picture, which I agreed to let him do, though it was a struggle to hold still with all the wind. I felt mildly uncomfortable at a comment Jose-Luis made about the blueness of my eyes. He spoke about how it's a privilege to take someone's picture, how there's an element of creation in each of us, and spiritual stuff like that. I tried to be receptive to what he was saying, but there was still a small part of me that never moved on from the contemptuousness of the *God Delusion* phase I went through as a teenager. I knew it was something I needed to work on.

A little while later I stopped in at a shop and chatted to the shopkeeper for a while. As it turned out, she knew Jose-Luis, and she seemed amused when I recounted the things he'd said to me. We agreed that *tiene sus cositas* ("he has his little things" - which I interpreted to mean "has his peculiarities").

I noticed that my mind tended to wander while I was walking, and I wasn't attentive to my surroundings. It wasn't a problem, as such, but it'd be a shame if I spent the whole Camino daydreaming. That said, I did stop to appreciate the scenery as I left Navia, a town about halfway between Villaprende and La Caridad, my final stop for the day.

I arrived at La Caridad without any other occurrences of note. The pilgrim hostel I chose was A Caridá. Basic but clean. I spoke with 3 different Spanish people there. Lots of Spanish practice that day.

Sketch of the typical bar or cafetería along the Camino. A sleepy place. Tiled floor, wooden counter, overly bright lights. Tortilla de patatas and meat sandwiches on display. One type of beer on tap, if any. Usually Estrella. Otherwise, it's 330ml bottles. You just ask for *cerveza* or *vino* - no fussing over options here, thank you very much! Old men sitting at the counter, just like you'd see in an Irish pub. They speak in the local language, or they speak Spanish so quickly and with such a strong accent that it may as well be a different language. Sometimes they still wear their work clothes, trousers stained with mud from working outdoors. Trash TV in the background, and a gambling machine in the corner. Relatively cheap - that day I paid €3.30 for black tea and pain au chocolate. In Ireland that'd probably cost at least €6. In the bathroom, the hand dryer is always broken.

More about prices. Bottles of wine cost €2-10 in the supermarkets. In Ireland, you'd pay €10 for the cheapest bottles of wine at Tesco.

During the day I was saddened to see some dairy cows in a barn, separated from their calves by metal fencing and a distance of 100-200m.

### Day 18, Wednesday, October 25th, Ribadeo
I didn't sleep very well. Got woken up by a mosquito buzzing in my ear. The bathroom had the highest urinal I'd ever seen, I had to stand on my tippy toes to reach it. Various people entered into the room while I was trying to sleep, with torches hanging from their necks and flashing in all directions. Rustling of plastic bags. Deafening alarms in the morning.

I left for Ribadeo at 7/8am, before sunrise. It was another day of strong wind. I tried to be more "present", after my reflections of the day before, but it wasn't long before my mind started to wander again.

Walking, shouting into the wind, worrying about my sore ankle. Arrived at *Puente de Santos* (Bridge of Saints), a 600m-long bridge that led into Ribadeo. This was the crossover point into the autonomous community of Galicia. The bridge was high above the river below, and so windy that it literally took my breath away. I made it across safely, and was then amused at a cyclist passing me in the opposite direction. He didn't get off his bike for the crossing, and as he moved into the distance I could've sworn I saw him get knocked over by the wind. My phone was dead by this point, so I had to ask random passersby for directions to the hostel.

The hostel was clean, and spacious due to a lack of pilgrims. I had my own bunkbed in a corner of the room, which gave me a good deal of privacy. I ate at Kalpa Amodiño, an Indian-Iberian fusion restaurant. Stuffed roti, home-brewed kombucha, and a coconut dessert - all delicious! The server was friendly, and also there was the owner's 10-year-old daughter, who was very cute.

That night I wasted a couple of hours browsing Reddit before going to sleep around 2am.

### Day 19, Thursday, October 26th
A day of heavy rain. I had breakfast with a Czech, a French woman (who'd cycled all the way from Norway over 5 months), an Andalucian, and a French couple who were doing the Camino by car. All were friendly. I ordered another tea, avoiding the rain for as long as possible. When I did leave, the rain and greyness of the day made it a melancholic walk through the streets. I saw the restaurant from the day before and felt sad that I mightn't ever eat there again, nor pass through Ribadeo itself.

Before even making it out of the city, the rain got so bad that I sought refuge under a café terrace. I ordered 6 churros with chocolate, and yet another black tea, and spent a couple of hours reading my book and enjoying the moody atmosphere and rain sounds.

While I was sitting there, an older American woman approached me - she recognised me from the hostel - and we chatted for a while. Her name was Griffin, and she was from New Mexico. Her nickname was "Doc", probably because she had done a history PhD. Among other things, she told me about the Episcopal Church and how it was basically the US equivalent of the Anglican Church in England. It has male and female priests, and they can get married. They even had a gay head bishop (the equivalent of the archibishop of Canterbury). However, she did add that this resulted in the departure of some homophobic congregants, who promptly registered at another, more conservative church. Griffin was on her way to Santiago to volunteer at a place called Pilgrim House, although her intention to walk the whole way there had been curtailed by an injury.

(at 11:41am GMT+1, I posted the Camino bingo thread - <https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/comments/17gtl22/bingo_card_for_camino_de_santiago/>)

I left at around 11am, bidding farewell to Ribadeo and the sea.
(Does the path go inland?)
Not many people. Woods. Ascents. It started to rain again while I was walking through the forest. I hid among the trees in an improvised shelter that someone else had made from branches. I hung the poncho over the shelter like a tarpaulin, and waited for the rain to ease up. Meanwhile, there were two slugs shagging at my feet, which made me feel like David Attenborough in a hidden observation post.
(Is that what it's called?)
There was a croaking sound at my back. Perhaps I was half asleep, but I somehow perceived it as the growling of a mother wolf, protective of her cubs and ready to tear my throat out. I didn't humour my delusions by turning around to check, though.

Eventually, I resigned myself to getting wet, because I'd been there for ages and there wasn't even a small patch of blue in the sky. Fortunately, it actually did stop raining a short while after I set off again.

Around 6pm, after walking for 17km, I arrived at Granja de Calor ("farm of warmth"), a donativo albergue.
(was that from Ribadeo?)
Aurora had told me about this place a few hours before. I wanted to walk further, but my phone was running out of battery, so I decided to stop in to charge it and have a rest.

There were 3 German people living there. Freddy and Nicole were the owners, and Andy was their guest. There was also Cami, Andy's dog. Back in Frankfurt, Freddy had been a masseuse / sauna guy and Nicole had been a kindergarten teacher. They had bought this land about 2 years previously, after passing by it while doing the Northern Way. Their land was nestled among a rural community of about 30 people. Their goal was to live self-sufficiently. Andy had stayed with them during his own Camino, and had returned to help out on their farm for a while. During that same Camino he'd found Cami the dog (who was very affectionate) unattended in a forest and had adopted her.

More about the farm. They were learning about farming and homesteading from videos on YouTube. They had sheep, chickens, rabbits and vegetables. Nicole said she would only eat meat from animals they'd slaughtered themselves. Their neighbours were curious about them, since, in such a small community, it was unusual to see new faces, never mind 2 foreigners. The neighbours were also kind and welcoming. There was an annual festival that attracted about 2000 people, it involved a music concert that only started at midnight and carried on well into the night. Wolves in the area would prey on sheep, so they had to keep their sheep inside after dark.

I initially sat down just to chat, have a cup of tea, and charge my phone, but I realised that the next step was over 3 hours away and it'd be completely dark by the time I arrived there. So, I felt I didn't have a choice but to stay. There was a brief moment of panic where I regretted my decision. They had the skins of slaughtered rabbits hanging in their workshop, their farmhouse was grotty, it was isolated, and I'd be the only pilgrim staying there. The perfect recipe for a Texas Chainsaw Massacre situation. However, a quick bit of internet research turned up some positive reviews that reassured me that they weren't crazed killers.

Freddy showed me around the property. They had a barn for their animals, and they were in the middle of building a sauna that they would market to passing pilgrims. I then helped them to chop vegetables from their garden for dinner. There were 2 woodlice hiding in the onion, and a mouse was hiding in the kitchen somewhere, but the food turned out well. Salted padrón peppers, scrambled eggs mixed with peppers, and bread. It was often like Russian roulette eating these peppers, as one in every few turned out to be VERY spicy. Still, I really appreciated this meal for its simple but tasty flavours.

Freddy shared a line that was part of their philosophy for the farm: *cada uno en su casa haz lo que quiera*, or "each person in their home do what they want". I guess that's not an unusual idea for people who move to the middle of nowhere to escape city life.

That night, I didn't feel comfortable in the bed. The room was dusty and creepy. The main entrance to the house was drafty, and it was very cold. I forgot to ask Freddy and Nicole for a blanket before they went to bed, so I thought I was going to be awake freezing the whole night, but thankfully Freddy came back downstairs for something and a blanket was bestowed upon me, and I managed to get to sleep.
