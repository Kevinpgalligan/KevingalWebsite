**PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:** Alice, Bob.

**SCENE:** A caf√© somewhere.

----

**BOB:** Can you suggest a good open source project to learn from and potentially contribute to, Alice?

**ALICE:** That depends, Bob. Why do you want to do that in the first place?

**BOB:** Well, a friend of mine called... Cob... suggested that it's a good way to learn about software. Like a beginning artist learning from master painters!

**ALICE:** Hm. I won't argue that getting involved in open source software can't be beneficial. But I don't think "go read open source" by itself is good advice for new programmers.

**BOB:** And why is that?

**ALICE:** Let's say that "Cob" tells you to just go and read code from a honking big project somewhere. I see two problems with this. First, why should you care about the project? It was randomly selected from a hat of Cob's favourite software projects. It probably has no relevance to your life. Unless it immediately strikes you as interesting or useful, you won't have any prior motivation to get involved.

**BOB:** That's true. Cob told me to look at the code for a project called *Flask*. I think it was something called a web framework? I had no idea what it was about.

**ALICE:** Right. Then there's my second point. Telling someone to go and read good code doesn't work. How are they supposed to know where to start on a project that has tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions of lines of code? Something something. And anyway, it's rare even for experienced programmers to read code as a learning activity (Gigamonkey). It's not like advising a writer to read good literature.

**BOB:** What a wise and reasonable response to that shamelessly concocted strawman known as Cob. So what's your undoubtedly sensible alternative, Alice?

**ALICE:** something something, start with your own project. [I would argue that you can't. Or at least, that it's much more difficult than it needs to be. Over the years, I have discovered that it's much easier to approach this problem from the other direction. Rather than setting out in an arbitrary direction and picking a random software project that someone suggests to you, the first step to getting involved in open source software should be to *use it*. Is there a cool personal project you want to work on? Well, as your projects grow in complexity, they'll require more open source packages. And those packages will, at some point, break. At which point, someone will have to step in and fix them -- and that person can be you! And believe me, open source packages do break.]

**BOB:** But what if I don't have my own ideas!?

**ALICE:** Doesn't matter, pick anything. Even if a package doesn't break and you never get your break-out opportunity, by using the package (1) it's useful for you, (2) you understand what it's used for, (3) you might have an idea of how it works, at least from an external perspective, (4) you might be curious about how it works internally, (5) maybe there's a feature that would be super useful for you that hasn't been added yet. That's like 5 things that could motivate you or help you to get involved!

You don't even have to use it as part of your own projects. Just use cool software day-to-day, like a calendar or a calculator or what have you. And maybe you'll find bugs in this software, or you'll find yourself wishing for a feature that's missing. Then you have the perfect opportunity to step in and make things better (assuming you use open source software; if not, then it's time to change that).

**BOB:** Okay, so you're dead-set against learning via reading open source code. What if you want to get involved in the open source *community*, and learn from the sages of open source?

**ALICE:** That's a nobler motive, but still suffers from the problems of motivation. Unless you have high intrinsic motivation, I would advise against it. [I'm not an expert on the "philosophy" of open source software, but this seems like a more sustainable dynamic for the open source ecosystem in general. Software that is maintained by people who care about it and who are motivated to develop it and who use it every day. As opposed to random people coming along, who don't care about the software or have any particular use for it, who contribute the minimum required amount to pad their CV and then move on. That's an unsustainable approach, you can't expect people to work on software that they have no reason to give a shit about. And you can't expect yourself to be motivated to dig into software, or to want to contribute to it, if it doesn't mean anything to you.]

**BOB:** But I need something to put on my CV!

**ALICE:** That may be the case, you filthy company-worshipping mercenary. But which is a better story... (1) I was working on my own project that I came up with myself, and I came up against a bug in a library I was using, so I delved into the low-level library code, understood what was going wrong, and fixed it! Then I became super interested in the library and added more features to it, for the public good. (2) I went looking for a project to work on to pad my CV, smashed some easy issues in an open source project that I don't care so much about.

Okay, I'm not saying it can't work. But if you're spinning your wheels and asking people "what's a good project to get involved in?", you should at least consider working on your own project and arriving at open source more naturally.

Final comment: smaller software ecosystems are easier to find gaps in. And the less well known and used a project is, the more likely you are to find bugs in it. Chad Common Lisp vs Virgin Python, for example.

**BOB:** Something funny.
