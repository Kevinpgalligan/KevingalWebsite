title: Are your dice fair?
date: 2020-04-16
draft: yes

While clearing out my room, I discovered an old wooden die. Since I had no use for it, and I was filling my brain with useless stuff like probability and statistics at the time, I decided to run a test on the die to see if it was fair. A "hypothesis" test, as they call it in statistics, which I knew nothing about.

Picture of the die here.
