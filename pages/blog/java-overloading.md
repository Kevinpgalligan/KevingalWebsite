In the year 2-0-0-0, Guy Steele gave his talk "blah". He did not use any words of more than one syllable (!!!) if he did not first say what they meant.

A computer is blah. A language is a bunch of words and rules for how to use them. A programming language is a language that you can use to tell a computer what to do. In this post, I use the same schtick as Guy Steele while I talk about how the Java programming language has not changed since Guy Steele's talk. Java is a high-level (!!!) programming language that cleans up for you.
