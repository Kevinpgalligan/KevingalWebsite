The comedian George Carlin had a bit known as [Things You Never See](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X0F1Qjn0Ac), where he listed off a series of things you never see or hear (or want to hear) in day-to-day life. It occurred to me that these might be amusing prompts for AI image generation, while giving me an opportunity to play around with trendy tools like DALL-E. I will warn you now that some of the prompts and resulting images are **NOT SUITABLE FOR WORK**.

The first roadblock I encountered was that you now have to pay to use the DALL-E web interface. Me being a cheap bastard, I had to look at other options. Bing Image Creator was the next one I tried.

[X] You never see a Rolls-Royce with a bumper sticker that says "shit happens". (Bing Image Creator)

[X] You never see a wheelchair with a roll bar. (Bing Image Creator)

[X] You don't want to come home and hear "Honey, remember how we told the children never to play on the railroad tracks?".
[] You don't want to be sitting in your doctor's office and hear "Well Jim, there's no reason why you shouldn't live another 20 to 30 years. However, you will be bleeding constantly from both eyes".
[] You don't want to hear "I'M PREGNANT, YOU'RE THE FATHER, AND I'M GOING TO KILL ALL 3 OF US!"
[] You don't want to hear "Honey, it's the police. They have a search warrant and the 300 kilos of cocaine are still sitting out in the living room."
[] You don't want to hear your fianc√© say "I'll be right back, I've gotta take a dump" while the two of you are having dinner together with your parents for the first time.
