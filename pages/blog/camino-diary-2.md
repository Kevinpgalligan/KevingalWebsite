### Day 6, Friday, October 13th 2023, Santillana del Mar (37km, 157.1km total)
That day's journey would be from Santander to Santillana del Mar. It was the longest segment thus far, about 37km. Despite the long distance, and despite the heavy use of asphalt roads, and despite my concerns about my dodgy hip, it all went fine. My hip seemed to have fixed itself overnight.

Like on every other day, I saw a lot of farms and animals. There was also usually at least one friendly Spaniard who'd shout out "Buen Camino!" to me and other pilgrims as we walked by. I met a German woman called Maika who had started her Camino that day in Santander. I also met another Johann from the Netherlands (not Johann of Johann and Joepke fame). Johann and I walked the last part of the segment together, finally arriving in Santillana, a popular tourist town with aesthetic cobblestone streets. We went straight to the convent where we were planning to stay, and once again there were familiar faces: Wesley and Aurora, Felipe from Sevilla, Marty the American, Nikola the monolingual Frenchman, and Stein the blunt Belgian guy.

After exploring the town for a bit, I returned to the convent to attend a so-called pilgrim meeting they were hosting. The other pilgrims and I were joined by 3 nuns. We introduced ourselves, and the nuns explained the purpose of the convent-albergue. The convent was founded in the 17th century, and cerca 2016 began offering services as a pilgrim hostel. They were currently employing 8 immigrant workers (asylum seekers?) at the albergue, to help them integrate in the community. We took turns doing readings from a booklet and did a bit of singing. I'm not religious, but it was a  After that, it was dinner time. I ate a tortilla, soup, and a custard dessert. I thought about how much more difficult the Camino must be for vegans. I also had 4 very annoying mosquito bites.

By the time we arrived at the convent earlier, it was already late in the day and all the beds were taken, so Johann and I (and Maika, who arrived after us) were given mattresses on the floor to sleep on. From chatting to Felipe and Stein, I discovered that Felipe was the head of the Spanish subsidiary of a media company called Rosco (or something like that), while Stein owned a company that employed 200 engineers. I didn't realise I'd been walking among such high-powered individuals.

### Day 7, Saturday, October 14th, San Vicente de la Barquera (34km, 191.1 total)
Disaster! There was a flood in our room. Maika woke us all up at 7am, to widespread confusion and chaos. The water didn't soak through the mattresses, but we were completely surrounded. Fortunately, I'd left my bag on a table, and as far as I know, nobody else had their possessions badly damanged either. I was able to slide my mattress along the floor like a raft, and got to dry ground.

The cause of the flood was a massive downpour outside (and a broken drainpipe). It continued raining for most of the day. My feet and legs got soaked, including parts of my shorts and underwear. This was when I discovered that my poncho didn't cover the backs of my legs properly, and also that it could only do so much to keep heavy rain off my upper body. I was physically tired from the long trek the day before, and the segment had lots of hills.

At various points I walked with Johann, Stein, Maika, Wesley and Aurora. Eventually, I stumbled into San Vicente de la Barquera together with Wesley and Aurora. It seemed to be a surfing town, as we walked past surfers and a beach-side surf shop on the outskirts. I was exhausted and thoroughly wet.

We checked in at Albergue Nómada. I paid for the clothes washing/drying service, and later went for food (pizza) at the nearest restaurant I could find. It was a lively town, but between my tiredness and my shoes feeling like wet sponges, I wasn't motivated to explore it any further. The albergue didn't have any newspaper left for me to dry out my shoes, so instead I used tissue paper. I wasn't sure that I'd have the energy to complete the 40.6km segment the next day - the longest segment of the entire trip.

### Day 8, Sunday, October 15th, Llanes  (40.6km, 231.7km total)
I set out early after bidding farewell to Wesley and Aurora, but I got a bit lost in the maze-like streets of the town and ran into them again. We'd never agreed to team up, but we always seemed to end up walking together anyway, and by this point I felt very fond of them. I'd discovered that they were older than they appeared - Aurora was 38 and Wesley was 37. And Aurora had a 20-year-old daughter, which I would NEVER have guessed!

I felt well-rested, despite my misgivings the night before. We walked a lot and crossed from Cantabria into Asturias, greeted by mountains and a surprising amount of greenery.

We stopped to rest beside a concrete bridge. It had the acoustics of a cathedral, and we had a fun time singing and making noise under it.

We met lots of animals, like always. I loved seeing them, but I also felt sadly conscious of the suffering they must have been going through as farm animals. And the animals I saw in open fields weren't even the ones suffering the most. I passed many grey industrial farm buildings where chickens and cows and pigs were doubtless being held in horrific conditions.

After about 30km, I left Aurora and Wesley behind, because I still wanted to reach Llanes, the next stop on Buen Camino. My left foot had started to get sore, but I foolishly pressed on, eager to arrive before dark. Unfortunately, this resulted in the emergence of my first blister of the trip. I had to ascend a mountain trail, passing through a village. Due to FOMO, I also took a brief detour to visit a cliffside viewing point.

I managed to reach Llanes, blister be damned. I went to La Casona del Peregrino for accommodation. The receptionist directed me to a restaurant called Agora, where I ate vegan Fabana (an Asturian dish) and vegan croquettes. It was very tasty and I left another 5-star review in my wake.

### Day 9, Monday, October 16th, Ribadesella (31.4km, 263.1km total)
I slept, or at least stayed in bed, until 8am. My roommates, two older French women and a friendly German woman called Jana, had already left by then. I delayed my departure in order to wash my clothes, take care of the blister (I had a blister plaster to put on it), and rest up a bit more. I went to the supermarket at 9am to buy tape and gauze - extra cushioning for the blister, since it was painful when I walked.

I was mostly by myself for the day, which was fine. I passed out Jana and the Frenchies. Also got a baby goat to eat grass out of my hand!

I got lost twice: the first time, I was walking along a road and missed a marker for a turn-off. The second time was more painful. There was a fork in the trail, and I took the branch closer to the sea in order to catch some nice views. I was vaguely conscious from the Buen Camino app that this path would be longer and not as well signposted, but I didn't anticipate just how hilly it'd be. As I struggled up and down a series of steep hills, my phone died, and I started to doubt whether I was even on the right path anymore. In the end, I cut across a field and made my way back to the road. I was able to follow the road the rest of the way to Ribadesella, and the relief when I arrived was sublime. The upside of the misadventure was that there were indeed some nice cliff views, and I spotted an eagle while crossing the field.

I went to a bar to charge my phone, reserved a room at the hotel Covadonga, and after showering there and resting for a while, I went to search for food. It was late, and the one place that my map said was open - with decent veggie options - turned out to be closed permanently. I had to resort to another restaurant nearby. It ended up costing me €18 for a low-effort salad: a few leaves of lettuce, tomatoes, and some measly bits of veg. I also had the strong suspicion that the waiter was talking shit about me with one of the other patrons. Needless to say, I did not leave a 5-star review for this establishment.

During the day, I'd passed through the town of Poo. My nieces were greatly amused when I sent them a picture of the town's name on a sign.

### Day 10, Tuesday, October 17th, Priesca (28.6km, 291.7km total)
I left Ribadesella around 9am/10am. This turned out to be a difficult segment, with lots of ups and downs. While walking down one of the hills, I went over on my left ankle and hurt it a bit. Another annoying injury to accompany the blister on that foot. I didn't see many pilgrims, besides an *estandounidense* whom I recognised as the volunteer translator from Padre Ernesto's albergue. She was there with her partner and her dog, Coco. They were walking with another American and didn't seem interested in talking to me, so I overtook them.

While absorbed in a map on my phone, I got a fright from a flash of orange and black stripes in the corner of my eye. It seemed to be a writhing, snake-like creature, but it disappeared before I could get a proper look at it. I don't think there are snakes like that in Spain, so it was probably a salamander.

In another scary encounter, an angry German Shepherd lunged at me from the back of a passing pickup truck. It was held back by a chain, but for a second I thought I was screwed. Well, it wouldn't be a day on the Camino if I didn't get a jumpscare from an aggressive dog. It actually seemed to be normal on Spanish farms for dogs to be tied up with a chain around their neck. I don't think that'd be allowed in Ireland or the UK? Meanwhile, the cats were free to roam, and I often saw them crouched in fields, probably waiting for rodents.

I stopped for the day at Priesca, about 3km from Sebrayo, my intended destination. The albergue, La Rectoral, turned out to be really nice, with a friendly host called Susana. Also present at the albergue were Jana; the two French ladies; 4 Spanish guys I'd seen in passing; a guy called Lee, from Taiwan; and a momma cat and her kittens <3 Lee shared his pasta with me - there were no supermarkets or restaurants nearby, as this part of the route was more rural than before. From my own supplies I also ate an apple, a pear, a banana, and Alpro yoghurt. After dinner I spent a long time hanging out with the kittens.
