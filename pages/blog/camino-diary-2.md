### Day 6, Friday, October 13th 2023, Santillana del Mar (37km, 157.1km total)
I set off for Santillana del Mar. It was the longest segment thus far, about 37km. Despite that distance, and despite the heavy reliance on asphalt roads, and despite my concerns about my dodgy hip, it all went fine. My hip seemed to have fixed itself overnight.

Like on every other day, I saw a lot of farms and animals. There was also usually at least one friendly Spaniard who'd shout out "Buen Camino!" to me and other pilgrims as we walked by. I met a German woman called Maika who had started her Camino that day in Santander. I also met another Johann from the Netherlands (not Johann of Johann and Joepke fame). Johann and I walked the last part of the segment together, finally arriving in Santillana, a popular tourist town with aesthetic cobblestone streets. We went straight to the convent where we were planning to stay, and once again there were familiar faces: my favourite couple Wesley and Aurora, Felipe from Sevilla, Marty the American, Nikola the monolingual Frenchman, and Stein the blunt Belgian guy.

After exploring the town for a bit, I returned to the convent to attend a so-called pilgrim meeting they were hosting. The other pilgrims and I were joined by 3 nuns. We introduced ourselves, and the nuns explained the purpose of the convent-albergue. The convent was founded in the 17th century, and cerca 2016 began offering services as a pilgrim hostel. They tried to help immigrants to Spain by offering them jobs at the albergue, and they were currently employing 8 immigrant workers. We took turns doing readings from a booklet and did a bit of singing. After that, it was dinner time. I ate a tortilla, soup, and a custard dessert. I thought about how much more difficult the Camino must be for vegans. I also had 4 very annoying mosquito bites.

By the time we arrived at the convent, it was quite late in the day and all the beds were taken, so Johann and I (and Maika, who arrived after us) were given mattresses on the floor to sleep on. From chatting to Felipe and Stein, I discovered that Felipe was the head of the Spanish subsidiary of a media company called Rosco (or something like that), while Stein owned a company that employed 200 engineers. I didn't realise I'd been walking among such high-powered individuals.

### Day 7, Saturday, October 14th, San Vicente de la Barquera (34km, 191.1 total)
Disaster! There was a flood in our room. Maika woke us all up at 7am, to widespread confusion and chaos. There wasn't enough water to reach us on the mattresses, but we were surrounded by water. Fortunately, I'd left my bag on a table, and as far as I know, nobody else had their possessions badly damanged either. I was able to slide my mattress along the floor and get to dry ground.

The day didn't improve after that. The cause of the flood had been a damaged drainpipe, but also a massive downpour outside. It continued raining heavily for most of the day. My feet and legs were soaked, including parts of my shorts and underwear. This is when I discovered that my poncho didn't cover the backs of my legs properly, and also that it could only do so much to keep heavy rain off my upper body. It was miserable to walk in such weather. I was also physically tired from the long trek the day before. The final nail in the coffin was that this segment had lots of hills.

At various points I walked with Johann, Stein, Maika, Wesley and Aurora. Eventually, Wesley and Aurora and I stumbled into San Vicente de la Barquera together, exhausted and thoroughly wet. We were staying at Albergue Nómada. I paid for the clothes washing/drying service, and later went for food (pizza) at the nearest restaurant I could find. I was wrecked and my shoes were still wet, so I didn't want to explore the town any further. That night, I put some tissue or newspaper in my shoes to dry them. I wasn't sure that I'd have the energy to complete the 40.6km segment the next day - the longest segment of the entire trip.

### Day 8, Sunday, October 15th, Llanes ...
I set out early after bidding farewell to Wesley and Aurora, but I got a bit lost in the maze-like streets of the town and ended up running into them again. We never agreed to team up, but we often ended up walking together anyway, and by this point I felt very fond of them. I'd discovered that Aurora was 38 and Wesley was 37. And Aurora had a 20-year-old daughter, which I did NOT expect!

I felt a lot better than the day before. We walked a lot. We crossed from Cantabria into Asturias, where we were greeted by beautiful landscapes. Asturias was... greener. Almost like Ireland. Not what I imagined Spain to look like.

We stopped to rest beside a concrete bridge. It had the acoustics of a cathedral, and we had a fun time singing and making noise under it.

We met lots of animals, like always. I loved seeing them, but there was also a part of me that felt sadly conscious of the suffering that farm animals go through. And the animals I'd seen in open fields weren't even the ones suffering the most. I'd passed many grey industrial farm buildings where chickens and cows and pigs were doubtless being held in horrific conditions.

After about 30km, I left Aurora and Wesley behind, because my plan was to reach the town of Llanes. My left foot had started to get sore, but I foolishly pressed on, eager to arrive before dark. Unfortunately, this resulted in the emergence of my first blister of the trip. Later, I applied a blister plaster I'd packed.

Despite the blister, I managed to reach Llanes. It was a lovely town. I went to La Casona del Peregrino for accommodation. The receptionist directed my to a restaurant called Agora, where I ate vegan Fabana (an Asturian dish) and vegan croquettes. It was very tasty and I left another 5-star review in my wake.

### Day 9, Monday, October 16th, Ribadesella ...
I slept, or at least stayed in bed, until 8am. My roommates, two older French women and a friendly German woman called Jana, had already left by then. I delayed my departure in order to wash my clothes, take care of the blister, and rest up a bit more. I went to the supermarket at 9am to buy tape and gauze to provide a cushion for the blister, since it was painful when I walked.

I was mostly by myself for the day, which was fine. I passed out Jana and the Frenchies. I got lost twice: the first time, I kept walking along a road after missing the Camino marker. The second time was more serious. There was a branch in the trail, and I took a coastal route in order to catch some nice views. I was vaguely conscious from the Buen Camino app that it was a longer path and not well signposted, but I didn't anticipate just how hilly it'd be. My phone died, and I ended up crossing a field in order to escape off the coastal path, as I wasn't sure I was even on it anymore. I was exhausted, and each hill was a struggle. The upside was that I randomly saw an eagle while crossing the field, and there were indeed some nice views, though by the end I was too exhausted and hungry to appreciate them. My relief on reaching Ribadesella was sublime. Oh, and I managed to get a cute goat to eat grass out of my hand!

I went to a bar to charge my phone, reserved a room at the hotel Covadonga, and after showering there and resting for a while, I went to search for food. It was late, and the one place that my map said was open - with decent veggie options - turned out to be closed permanently. I had to resort to another restaurant nearby. It ended up costing me €18 for a low-effort salad: a few leaves of lettuce, tomatoes, and a few other measly bits of veg. I also got the sense that the waiter was shit-talking me with one of his clientele. Needless to say, I did not leave a 5-star review for this establishment.

During the day, I'd passed through the town of Poo. My nieces were greatly amused when I sent them a picture of the town's name on a sign.

## Day 10, Tuesday, October 17th, Priesca
I left Ribadesella around 9am/10am. It turned out to be a difficult segment, with lots of ups and downs. While walking down one of the hills, I went over on my left ankle and hurt it a bit. Another annoying injury to accompany the blister on that foot. I didn't see many pilgrims, besides an *estandounidense* whom I recognised as the volunteer translator from Padre Ernesto's albergue. She was there with her partner and her dog, Coco. They were walking with another American and didn't seem interested in talking to me, so I overtook them.

While walking along and absorbed in a map on my phone, I got a fright from a flash of orange and black stripes in the corner of my eye. It seemed to be a writhing, snake-like creature, but it disappeared before I could get a proper look at it. I don't think there are snakes like that in Spain, so it was probably a salamander.

Another scary encounter. A pickup truck was driving past when an angry German Shepherd in the back lunged at me. It was held back by a chain, but for a second I thought I was screwed. Well, it wouldn't be a day on the Camino if I didn't get a jumpscare from an aggressive dog. It actually seemed to be normal on Spanish farms for dogs to be tied up with a chain around their neck. I don't think that'd be allowed in Ireland or the UK? Meanwhile, the cats were free to roam, and I often saw them crouched in fields, probably waiting for mice.

I stopped for the day at Priesca, about 3km from Sebrayo, my intended destination. The albergue, La Rectoral, was wonderful, with a friendly host called Susana. Also present at the albergue were Jana; the two French ladies; 4 Spanish guys I'd seen in passing; a guy called Lee, from Taiwan; and a momma cat and her kittens <3 Lee shared his pasta with me - there were no supermarkets or restaurants nearby, as this part of the route was more rural than before. From my own supplies I also ate an apple, a pear, a banana, and Alpro yoghurt. After dinner I spent a long time hanging out with the kittens.
