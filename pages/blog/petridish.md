title: Can great programmers be grown in a petri dish?

description: Whether great programmers are born or made.

I'd like to explore this question by examining a few case studies, namely:

* The MIT AI Lab (60s).
* The Bell Labs Unix room (70s).
* Xerox PARC?

## MIT AI Lab
Crammed into computer rooms with air conditioners humming constantly.

Collaborative: sitting around a single terminal, pair programming, mentoring, lively conversations, flow of ideas.

Even with the development of ITS, a timesharing operating system, all of their code was completely open. And would still collaborate. They could see what other people were doing. Eventually, through ARPANET, they were able to connect with other universities & companies and collaborate.

## The Unix Room
Brian Kernighan described 2 short corridors that led to computer teams, the Unix Room was in the middle of them. It encouraged people to bump into each other and swap ideas. Ken Thompson would spend most of his time in the Unix Room (y'know, the guy who banged out the first version of the Unix operating system in 3 weeks). Again, they used a timesharing system. You could run `who` command to see who was online and the last time they'd done something. Liberal permissions, see other people's code.

Common thread: shared goals. MIT guys wanted to improve the system and pull off dazzling hacks. The Unix guys were developing this operating system together? (Need to read up on what they were doing).

## Conclusions
Not perfect (AI Lab suicide attempts, doesn't sound like it was particularly welcoming to women). And maybe it's just a case of "get the smartest people in a room and they'll do gud". But if you wanted to grow a lot as a programmer... put yourself in a small environment with smart people, learn from them. Work towards a common goal. Develop a sense of community; you can achieve more by collaborating, as Bill Gosper realised at the beginning of the 70s when he witnessed the Apollo 17 Moonshot.

Parallels with the modern world. Open source is gud. Internet enables collaboration (chat rooms). Funny, though, how we don't really have an edge over these programmers from the 60s in terms of our learning opportunities. I would actually say that their environment was more suited to it, since they had a bunch of fanatics in a hotbox.
