tags: rc

Possible sections:

- What I did.
- What should I have done differently?
- Being remote, sense of connection.
- Zulip.
- Virtual RC.
- Presentations.
- Check-ins (my way of staying up-to-date).
- Blog post vs check-ins.
- Events (busy busy calendar).
- Pairing, coffee chats.
- Niceties.
- Diversity (genders, countries, backgrounds (music, chemistry, physics, English)) & culture of kindness. Contrast with the tech mood I don't like.
