title: Did Lennon-McCartney really love "you"?

draft: yes

Browsing the [Wikipedia page of Lennon-McCartney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon–McCartney), a Beatles fact caught my interest.

    Author David Rowley points out that at least half of all Lennon–McCartney lyrics have the words "you" and/or "your" in the first line.

This comes from page 3 of the book *Help! 50 Songwriting, Recording and Career Tips used by the Beatles*. The book gives a tip that song-writers should put the word "you" in the first line of their song lyrics, stating:

    Around half of all Lennon-McCartney lyrics use the magic songwriting words 'you or 'your' in the first line.

    These words, especially when used with the words 'I' or 'me', allow the listener to imagine that the song is about them and allow the listener to imagine that they are singing the song to another person.

    The opening words of the following songs are all addressed directly to the listener. 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', 'We can Work It Out', 'Taxman', 'Tomorrow Never Knows', 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds', 'With a Little Help From My Friends', 'It's Only a Northern Song', 'Baby You're a Rich Man', 'Glass Onion', 'Revolution'. Indeed, on some of these songs it sounds as if the Beatles wrote the lyrics as though they were having a conversation with their listener.

This statement is conspicuously unquantified. What exact percentage of the Beatles songs have the words "you" or "your" in the first line? How does this compare to the contemporaries of the Beatles and the musicians who came before them? Is this really a valid "Beatles" song-writing tip, i.e. should song-writers who seek to emulate the success of the Beatles really put the word "you" in the first line, or is David Rowley talking out of his ass? This post will answer these questions and more.

TODO: add an image of the Beatles.

### Gathering the lyrics
Download lyrics to perform analysis.

### The percentage
What percentage of songs have "you" or "your" in the first line.

Other thing to consider: proportion of you's and your's vs his, her, he, she, they, theirs, it, its. This might be a more accurate measure of whether they're directly addressing the reader.

Also, careful of you're, yours.

### Comparing to other musicians
Contemporary, before, after.

### Conclusion
Is it a valid tip?
