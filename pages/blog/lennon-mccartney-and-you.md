title: Did Lennon-McCartney really love "you"?

Browsing the [Wikipedia page of Lennon-McCartney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon–McCartney), a fun fact caught my interest.

> Author David Rowley points out that at least half of all Lennon–McCartney lyrics have the words "you" and/or "your" in the first line.

This refers to page 3 of the book *Help! 50 Songwriting, Recording and Career Tips used by the Beatles*, which suggests that song-writers should put the word "you" in the first line of their lyrics:

> Around half of all Lennon-McCartney lyrics use the magic songwriting words 'you or 'your' in the first line.

> These words, especially when used with the words 'I' or 'me', allow the listener to imagine that the song is about them and allow the listener to imagine that they are singing the song to another person.

> The opening words of the following songs are all addressed directly to the listener. 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', 'We can Work It Out', 'Taxman', [...]. Indeed, on some of these songs it sounds as if the Beatles wrote the lyrics as though they were having a conversation with their listener.

This brings several **incredibly important** questions to mind. How many Beatles songs refer to "you" in the first line, exactly? How does this compare to the you-rate of other musicians? And, perhaps most interestingly, is there actually a correlation between chart success and the inclusion of "you" in the first line of a song, or was David Rowley blowing hot steam out of his ass? This post will answer these questions.

### How many Beatles songs refer to "you" in the first line?
Describe what data was scraped, how it was scraped, percentage with "you" in first line. Verisimilitude of his claim.

Total songs: 428, total 'you' songs: 118.

The Beatles were active from 1962, with the release of the single *Love Me Do*, until 1970, with the release of the album *Let It Be*.

### The percentage
What percentage of songs have "you" or "your" in the first line.

Other thing to consider: proportion of you's and your's vs his, her, he, she, they, theirs, it, its. This might be a more accurate measure of whether they're directly addressing the reader.

Also, careful of you're, yours.

### Comparing to other musicians
Contemporary, before, after.

### Conclusion
Is it a valid tip?
