title: I love ads!

description: After 20-odd years, I've had an epiphany.

I haven't owned a television in 8 years. It was only 4 months ago, after moving home to live with my parents, that I became reacquainted with television advertising. Since then, I've been exposed to the background hum of television on a daily basis. It's always there. Crooning to me as I sit down for dinner. Whispering in my ear as I fall asleep on the couch. Shouting at me as I leave the room in search of quiet. Jumping up and down at my knee, begging for attention. It's the ad, ad-vert, ad-ver-tisement. 15 minutes for every hour of TV.

At first, I resisted this new source of distraction. I use ad-blocking software for a reason, I thought. Ads aren't good for you, and they're for suckers. The whole concept of advertising is fucked up. I would be happy if I never saw another ad for the rest of my life.

O, what a fool I was. For 8 years - 8 long years! - I rejected the comforting embrace of the marketer, cast out the copywriter, and declined to break bread with the ad executive. I, a sociable animal, made myself a hermit. It's incredible to me now that I could ever have been so cruel to myself. That I could turn away from the warm glow of the ad, when it's the nature of humans to seek warmth.

But worry not, my friend, for the wandering lamb has returned to the fold. After prolonged exposure to TV marketing, I have hit upon a wonderful revelation. And the revelation is this.

*I love ads!*

It's a trillion-dollar industry with the best of intentions. Rank upon smiling rank of ad executive, writer, creative director, smart-talker, smart-walker and CEO - all working away happily to construct a personalised message that's just for me. These are difficult times, but it is of great comfort to me to know that such a powerful force for good is out there in the world, with only my best interest at heart.

O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! But it is all right now. Everything is all right, the struggle is finished. I have won the victory over myself. I love ads.

*Note: this may or may not be a reference to the final scene of George Orwell's novel, 1984, in which Winston, after an indeterminate amount of torture and suffering, comes to the realisation that he loves Big Brother.*
