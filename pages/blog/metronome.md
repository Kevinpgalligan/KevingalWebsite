You might have heard already, but we're in the midst of a crisis.

A [website obesity crisis](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm).

The weight of the average website in 2017 was 3MB <a href="#website-size">[1]</a>. That's 3.5 times the size of a copy of The Brothers Karamazov <a href="#karamazov">[2]</a>. And you can be sure that things have gotten worse since then.

I'm reminded of the crisis whenever I try to use one of the many metronome apps littered around the web. If you don't know, a metronome is a tool that makes a ticking sound at regular intervals, allowing musicians to control their play speed.

I'm dissatisfied with the current offering of metronome web apps. Most of them don't work well on mobile, requiring you to set the speed of the metronome using a clumsy slider. They come with intrusive ads and bloated banners. They're overweight in the extreme. That's why I decided to make my own. An ad-free, no-bullshit metronome app. To make it more interesting, I also set myself the challenge of making it less than 1KB in size. Since people make [1KB JavaScript games for fun](https://js1k.com/), I was confident that it was possible.
