description: An AI that plays a really hard version of Tetris called HATETRIS.

This is a Common Lisp-based AI for playing HATETRIS, which is a really hard version of Tetris. HATETRIS gives you the worst possible piece every time, "worst" meaning the one that maximises the minimum possible height of the tower after your next move. The current human record (as of June 29th 2021) is 45 lines; LOVETRIS can clear 12 lines. This has made me respect the human brain a lot more.

I plan to improve the documentation and write a post about it at some point.
