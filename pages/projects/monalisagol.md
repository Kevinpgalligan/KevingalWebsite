description: Common Lisp software for tinkering with the Game of Life.

Common Lisp code that searches for Game of Life states that turn into a given picture. It can also be used to create GIFs of the Game of Life. [Write-up here](https://kevingal.com/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html).

Goes well with Pixelate, because you can: (1) take your own picture, (2) shrink it and turn it black & white (using Pixelate), and then (3) pass it to MonaLisaGol to find a Life state that turns into your picture. Or just run your picture as a Life simulation, which is also cool.
