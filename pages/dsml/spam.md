name: SMS Spam Classification

I implemented a Naive Bayes classifier to achieve almost 99% test set accuracy on Kaggle's [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/). The classifier also achieved high precision (98.8%) and recall (92.7%). The features were based on words used, as well as the presence of money symbols and numbers of various lengths.
