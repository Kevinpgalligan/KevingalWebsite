### [Emojipasta Generator](/apps/emojipasta.html) ðŸŒŽ
Add word-relevant ðŸ¤– emojis âœ¨ to text with sometimes hilarious results. Based on [AnEmojipastaBot](https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/EmojipastaBot), which I unleashed on Reddit a few years ago.

### [Pixelate](/apps/pixelate.html) ðŸŒŽ
Make images more pixely, make them black & white, or resize them. I used it for [this](/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html) blog post.

### [Tiny Metronome](/apps/metronome.html) ðŸŒŽ
A mobile-friendly, 981-byte metronome. I made it because most of the metronome web apps I found on the internet were bloated, or clunky on mobile. I also wrote about this app in a [blog post](/blog/metronome.html).

### [bs](https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/bs) ðŸ“¥
A Python CLI tool that converts numbers between bases with as little typing as possible. If you don't specify the base, it does all valid conversions between common ones.

Installation:

    pip3 install base-convert-cli

	$ bs -t d F
	15

### [pseu](https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/pseu) ðŸ“¥

	$ pseu pick "good life choice" "bad life choice"
