## Lists
I'm a big fan of lists.

* [Blogs](/lists/blogs.html) that I've bookmarked or added to my RSS feed, mostly mathsy or computery in nature.

* [Stuff to learn](/lists/learning.html): various topics in maths, computer science, music, and so on. And how I plan to learn them. Mostly consists of reading material.

* [Books](/lists/books.html) that I'd like to read, or have read.

* [Movies](/lists/movies.html): same, but for movies.

* [Ideas](/lists/ideas.html): project ideas.
