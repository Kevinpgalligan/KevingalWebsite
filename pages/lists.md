## Lists
I spend a lot of time curating lists for myself. I may as well share them with other people.

* [Blogs](/lists/blogs.html): various blogs that I've bookmarked or added to my RSS feed, mostly mathsy or computery in nature.

* [Stuff to learn](/lists/learning.html): various topics in maths, computer science, music, and so on. And how I plan to learn them. Mostly consists of reading material.

* [Books](/lists/books.html): books that I'd like to read, or have read. Mostly fiction.

* [Movies](/lists/movies.html): same, but for movies.

* [Ideas](/lists/ideas.html): project ideas.
